# **Bronchodilators (B.A.M.)**
- **Beta-Adrenergic Agonists** - activate the sympathetic nervous system, which relaxes bronchial smooth muscle
	- Albuterol
		- Actions
			- SABA that is used to relieve the bronchospasm of asthma
			- rapid onset and excellent safety profile = first-line drug for the termination of acute bronchospasm
			- facilitates mucus drainage and can inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals from mast cells.
			- When inhaled 15 to 30 ­minutes prior to physical activity, it can prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.
			- not recommended for asthma prophylaxis.
		- Administration Alerts
			- use only the actuator that comes with the canister. Observe and instruct the patient in proper use.
			- teratogenic in laboratory animals; however, human studies have not found increased birth defects or miscarriages. Effects on the breastfed neonate are not known.
		- Adverse Effects
			- palpitations, headaches, throat irritation, tremor, nervousness, restlessness, and tachycardia
			- Less common: dry mouth, insomnia, chest pain, allergic rxn
		- Contraindications
			- Hypersensitivity
			- Caution among patients with hx of cardiac disease, CAD, HTN
- **Anticholinergics** - block parasympathetic response
	- Ipratropium
		- Actions
			- relieve and prevent the bronchospasm that is characteristic of COPD
			- Combined with albuterol as first-line drug for bronchospasm from COPD
			- it is prescribed off-label for the disorder for asthma
			- Alternative to SABA
		- Alerts
			- MDI use
			- Wait 2-3 min between dosages
			- No evidence of fetal harm
		- Adverse
			- Little absorbed by lungs = few systemic changes
			- Irritation of URI due to drying of nasal mucosa
			- Bitter taste
			- May cause epistaxis (nasal)
		- Contraindications
			- Hypersensitivity to soy or related to soy or peanut
- **Methylxanthines**
	- Class of bronchodilators used to manage asthma and COPD, commonly includes theophylline and aminophylline
	- Relaxes smooth muscles of the bronchial airways, reduces airway responsiveness to irritants
	- Used in chronic asthma management, sometimes in COPD, less commonly used due to narrow therapeutic window and side effects
	- Nausea, vomiting, insomnia, nervousness, tachycardia, arrhythmias, seizures in toxicity cases
	- Nursing Considerations (GPT)
	    - Monitor serum drug levels to prevent toxicity
	    - Assess for signs of toxicity such as nausea, restlessness, and arrhythmias
	    - Educate clients to avoid caffeine, as it can increase drug effects
	    - Ensure consistent administration to maintain therapeutic levels
	    - Monitor cardiac status, especially in clients with cardiovascular conditions
	    - Inform clients about the importance of regular blood tests to monitor drug levels
	    - Caution when using in older adults due to increased sensitivity to side effects
# **Anti-inflammatory (S.L.M)**
- **Corticosteroids - “steroids”**
	- Beclomethasone
		- Actions
			- aerosol inhalation (Qvar) for asthma or as a nasal spray (Beconase AQ, Qnasl) for allergic rhinitis.
			- first-line drugs for the long-term management of persistent asthma in both children and adults.
			- 3-4 weeks before optimal benefits are obtained.
			- reduce inflammation, thus decreasing the frequency of asthma attacks.
			- not used as a rescue inhaler
		- Adverse
			- if swallowed, observe for signs of corticosteroid toxicity.
			- Local effects may include hoarseness, dry mouth, and changes in taste.
			- Inhaled corticosteroid use has been associated with the development of cataracts in adults.
			- Long-term intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids may cause growth inhibition in children.
			- can mask signs of infection: do not use if infected
			- Oral thrush
		- Contraindications
			- Hypersensitivity
			- The growth of pediatric patients should be monitored carefully because inhaled corticosteroids may reduce growth velocity in some children.
- **Leukotriene Modifiers** - second-line drugs, considered when other meds failed to manage chronic asthma
	- mediators of the immune response that are involved in allergic and asthmatic reactions
	- **montelukast** (Singulair)
		- Actions and Uses
			- prophylaxis of persistent, chronic asthma; exercise-induced bronchospasm; and allergic rhinitis.
			- prevents airway edema and inflammation by blocking leukotriene receptors in the airways.
			- Given PO and acts rapidly, although it is not recommended for termination of acute bronchospasm.
			- Only drug in this class that is approved for pediatric use.
			- Available in chewable tablets and as granules that are recommended by the manufacturer to be mixed with applesauce, mashed carrots, or ice cream.
		- Administration Alerts
			- Do not use it to terminate acute asthma attacks.
			- If preventing exercise-induced bronchospasm, take drug at least 2 hours before the activity.
			- This drug did not show fetal harm in laboratory animals. Effects on the breastfed neonate are not known.
			- Adverse Effects
			- few serious adverse effects
			- headache, N/D
			- neuropsychiatric events, SA, hallucinations, depression
		- Contraindications:
			- The only contraindication is hypersensitivity to the drug.
			- Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should avoid taking montelukast.
			- Caution: patients with liver/hepatic failure
- **Mast Cell Stabilizers** - second-line drugs, considered when other meds failed to manage chronic asthma
