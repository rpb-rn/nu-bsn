**Anticoags from NurseintheMaking**
- Anticoagulants
	- prevent new clots from forming, prevent current clots from getting bigger; not blood thinners!
	- Uses: DVT, PE, A-Fib, post-op patients
	- **==Heparin==** (LMWH - Low Molecular Weight Heparin: Lovenox - generic enoxaparin)
		- IV or SQ
		- Rapid onset, Heparins Happens Fast - great for short term therapy
		- Monitor:
			- aPTT (heparin has “P” in it) - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time - how fast blood clots
			- “If numbers are high, the patient will die”, if low - clots will grow - must be therapeutic range
			- Antidote: Protamine Sulfate
		- Educate: subq 2” from umbilicus, 90deg, do not massage site, bruising/pain is common
	- **==Warfarin (Coumadin)==**
		- Commonly PO
		- Slow - hours-day / “Warfarin you have to Wait”
		- Can be given with Heparin together
		- Monitor:
			- INR - International Normalized Ratio - how fast blood clots
			- “If numbers are high, the patient will die”, if low - clots will grow - must be therapeutic range
			- Antidote: Vitamin K (during War, Vitamin K KILLS Warfarin!)
		- Educate:
			- Be consistent with Vit K intake - green leafy, liver

**Know the Difference!**
Anticoagulants - interfere with the body's clotting factors (proteins) in the coagulation cascade to prevent clot formation
	Uses: prevention of venous thromboembolisms (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke, afib
Antiplatelets - inhibit platelet aggregation (clumping) to prevent the formation of clots in arteries
	Uses: prevent heart attacks strokes, and other cardiovascular events related to atherosclerosis

Hemostasis - delicate balance regulated by substances in blood: procoagulants vs anticoagulants
- Thromboembolic Disorder - too much clotting (leads to thrombi or emboli)
- Coagulation Disorder - too little clotting, leads to excessive bleeding
	- Thrombocytopenia - decreased platelet production or super platelet destruction 

**Labs to diagnose bleeding disorder:**
prothrombin time (PT)
thrombin time
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
in some instances, a bleeding time.
