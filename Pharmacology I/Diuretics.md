**Loop Diuretics**
- Block reabsorption of Sodium and Chlorine in nephron Loop (Henle)
	- Increase UOP (even with diminished blood flow to kidney)
	- Where sodium goes, water flows
- used to reduce the edema associated with heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, or CKD
- **==furosemide (Lasix)==** - furiously gets rid of water!
	- Uses
		- HF, HTN, moderate to severe fluid retention 
		- beneficial when cardiac output and renal blood flow are severely diminished.
		- remove large amounts of excess fluid from the patient in a short period of time
		- IV: quick relief, 5 minutes onset
	- Actions
		- RAPID DIURESIS! The Nuclear bomb of diuretics
		- See above
	- Nursing Considerations
		- Report below normal potassium levels
		- Caution in infants, pregnant
		- Administer before 5pm (so patient does not pee all night)
		- Weigh daily, monitor I’s Os, monitor electrolytes
		- Increase potassium
		- Administer slowly! - can cause ototoxicity
	- Adverse Effects
		- Dehydration
		- Thirst, dry mouth, weight loss, HA, hypotension
		- electrolyte imbalance
		- Most important: Hypokalemia (can cause dysrhythmia or arrest)
		- Rare: ototoxicity - check for hearing loss!
	- Contraindications
		- Hypersensitivity
		- anuria, hepatic coma, and severe fluid or electrolyte depletion
		- Interactions
		- may diminish the hypoglycemic effects of insulin
		- Enhance K depleting effect of corticosteroids

**Thiazide Diuretics**
- Largest and most prescribed class of diuretics
- Not as strong as loop (entire loop), thiazide (ascending loop only)
- **==hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide)==**  - “hydro” + “chloro” - gets rid of  water & sodium chloride (NaCl)
	- Uses
		- HTN, edema
	- Actions
		- Block reabsorption of  NA, CL, and water at DCT
		- Increase excretion of K, Ca, Mg
	- Nursing Considerations
		- Administer before 5pm (so patient does not pee all night)
		- Weigh daily, monitor I’s Os, monitor electrolytes
		- Increase potassium
	- Adverse Effects
		- Dehydration
		- HypOkalemia
		- HypOnatremia
		- Precipitate gout attacks from hyperuricemia (was in my wife’s NCLEX)
	- Contraindications
		- Preeclampsia 
		- Interactions

**Potassium Sparing Diuretics**
- **==spironolactone (Aldactone)==** - “spiro” will SPARE your potassium! 
	- Uses
		- Mild HTN, edema, HF, ascites, nephrotic syndrome
		- most widely prescribed diuretic for HTN
		- May need other drugs for severe HTN
		- WEAK diuretic
	- Actions
		- Blocks aldosterone
		- Excretes water and Na, but retains K!!!
	- Nursing Considerations
		- Monitor K
		- Do not give K supplements
		- Avoid salt substitutes!
	- Adverse Effects
		- HypERkalemia
		- muscle weakness, fatigue, and bradycardia
		- Amenorrhea - no menstruation
		- Gynomastia - men get boobies
		- Impotence
	- Contraindications
		- Severe kidney failure
		- hyperkalemia
		- Interactions
		- Salicylates = increased K
		- Hyperkalemia - potassium supplements, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)

Misc
**Osmotic** - mannitol (?) - for increased ICP
