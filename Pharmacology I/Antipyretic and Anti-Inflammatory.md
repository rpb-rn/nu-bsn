**Anti-Inflammatory Drugs**
- **NSAIDS**
	- First line of drugs for mild-moderate inflammation
	- inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins
	- **==Ibuprofen==**
		- Mechanism
			- treatment of mild to moderate pain, fever, and inflammation.
			- efficacy is equivalent to that of aspirin and other NSAIDs
			- Due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis
			- indications include pain associated with chronic musculoskeletal disorders, such as RA and osteoarthritis, headache, dental pain, and dysmenorrhea.
		- Administration Alerts
			- Give on empty stomach
			- Asthma or allergies may have hypersensitivity
			- Caution: pregnancy. NSAID increases pregnancy risk.
			- DO NOT USE IN LATE PREGNANCY! (may prematurely close fetal ductus arteriosus)
		- Adverse Effects
			- nausea, heartburn, epigastric pain, and dizziness
			- Serious: GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines
			- may cause an increased risk of thrombotic events, MI, and stroke, which can be fatal
		- Contraindications
			- for the treatment of perioperative pain in those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery
			 - CKD or hepatic impairment
- **Corticosteroids** - should only be used for 1-3 weeks, then switch to NSAID
	- ==**Prednisone**==
		- Class - anti-inflammatory, corticosteroid
		- Actions and Uses
			- allergic and inflammatory disorders
			- metabolized to an active form, which is also available as a drug called prednisolone
			- When used for inflammation, duration of therapy is commonly limited to 4 to 10 days.
			- For long-term therapy, alternate-day dosing is often used, and the dosage is gradually lowered.
			- occasionally used to terminate acute bronchospasm in patients with asthma and as an antineoplastic drug for patients with certain cancers, such as Hodgkin’s disease, acute leukemia, and lymphomas.
			- Available in tablet and oral solution forms.
		- Administration Alerts
			- Administer with food and do not chew or divide tablets.
			- Do not use it if signs of a systemic infection are present.
			- When using the drug for more than 10 days, the dose must be slowly tapered.
			- May cause fetal harm
			- Do not use if breastfeeding
			- Do not stop abruptly! Taper of if used longer than 1-2 weeks
			- Adrenal insufficiency and crisis may occur with profound hypotension, tachycardia, and other adverse effects if the drug is stopped abruptly.
		- Adverse Effects
			- few serious adverse effects.
			- Long-term therapy may result in Cushing syndrome, a condition that includes hyperglycemia, fat redistribution to the shoulders and face, muscle weakness, bruising, and bones that easily fracture.
			- Because gastric ulcers may occur with long-term therapy, an antiulcer medication may be prescribed prophylactically. Use with caution in patients with peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, or diverticulitis. Mood changes, increased appetite, and weight gain may occur.
		- Contraindications:
			- Patients with serious viral, bacterial, fungal, or protozoan infections should not take prednisone.

**Antipyretics**
- **Acetaminophen**
	- Class - antipyretic, analgesic, para-aminophenol derivative
	- Actions and Uses
		- Reduces fever by direct action at the level of the hypothalamus and dilation of peripheral blood vessels, which enables sweating and dissipation of heat.
		- has no anti-inflammatory properties; therefore, it is not effective in treating arthritis or pain caused by tissue swelling following injury.
		- The primary therapeutic is for the treatment of fever in children and for relief of mild to moderate pain when aspirin is contraindicated.
		- may be combined with opioids - for synergistic dosing
		- Acetaminophen has no effect on platelet aggregation and does not exhibit cardiotoxicity.
		- Does not cause GI bleeding or ulcers or cause Reye syndrome in children (unlike NSAIDs)
	- Administration Alert
		- Never administer to patients who consume alcohol regularly due to the potential for drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
		- extreme care must be taken to not duplicate doses by taking several products concurrently
		- safe for pregnant
	- Adverse
		- generally safe, and adverse effects are uncommon at therapeutic doses.
		- Excessive acetaminophen use, especially when combined with alcohol use, is the number one cause of acute liver failure in the United States.
		- Chronic ingestion results in neutropenia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and CKD.
		- Stevens–Johnson syndrome
	- Contraindications
		- Hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or phenacetin and chronic alcohol consumption.
