Ch. 18.11 Drug Therapy for Migraines

Two major classes (both serotonin (5-HT) agonists:
- Triptans -  work by constricting intracranial vessels
- Ergot Alkaloids

Algorithm for treating migraine:
- Mild migraine - acetaminophen or NSAID. If ineffective, move to:
- Triptans
	- Usually in oral form (may cause N/V), alternative forms are available
	- Intranasal or prefilled syringes also available
	- All triptans have similar effectiveness and side effects
	- If ineffective, move to:
- Ergot Alkaloids
	- Ergotamine - inexpensive, available in oral, SL, suppository
	- Dihydroergotamine - nasal spray
	- Interact with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors and serotonergic receptors => many side effects.
	- Some E.A can cause fetal harm and should not be used by women who may become pregnant!
