- **Local Anesthetics** - loss of sensation to a relatively small part of the body for a brief medical or dental procedure.
	- Esters
		- Benzocaine, Procaine  (Novocain)
		- Adverse: CNS depression, burning, stinging, redness
	- Amidies
		- Articaine, lidocaine
		- Adverse: burning, stinging, redness at site
- **General Anesthetics**
	- IV
		- ==**Propofol**== (Diprivan)
			- MOA - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist
			- Primary Actions
				- Most widely used IV anesthetics due to efficacy and safety profile
				- indicated for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia
				- immediate onset of action and is used effectively for conscious sedation
				- Emergence is rapid and few adverse effects occur during recovery. 
				- Has an antiemetic effect that can prevent nausea and vomiting.
			- Alerts
				- faster onset and deeper sedation compared to benzo
				- not showed evidence of fetal harm
				- Adverse effects on breastmilk => neonate
			- Adverse
				- Pain, apnea, resp depression, hypOtension
				- collection of metabolic abnormalities and organ system failures, aka, propofol infusion syndrome (PIF)
				- severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, lipidemia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, and cardiac failure.
		- Inhaled
			- Therapeutic Gasses
				- **==Nitrous Oxide==**
					- Primary Actions
						- analgesia caused by suppression of pain mechanisms in the CNS
						- low potency and does not produce complete loss of consciousness or profound relaxation of skeletal muscle
						- commonly combined with other surgical anesthetic agents. 
						- Ideal for short surgical or dental procedures because the patient remains conscious and can follow instructions while experiencing full analgesia.
						- always combined with oxygen (25 to 30%) and is administered in a semi closed method through a tube or by mask.
					- Alerts
						- Does NOT cause fetal harm
						- Adverse
						- Few adverse in low dose
						- At higher doses, stage 2 anesthesia such as anxiety, excitement, and combativeness
						- Lower dose will reverse
						- difficulty breathing or experience nausea and vomiting following the procedure
					- Contra
						 - impaired consciousness, head injury, non-compliance, decompression sickness, nitrogen narcosis, air embolism, undiagnosed abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, hypotension, shock, COPD, cyanosis, pneumothorax, or air transport.
						- Use nitrous oxide cautiously in myasthenia gravis due to respiratory depression and prolonged effects. Monitor cardiovascular patients, especially with elevated ICP, for prolonged or potentiated hypnotic effects
							- Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which antibodies destroy the communication between nerves and muscle, resulting in weakness of the skeletal muscles. Myasthenia gravis affects the voluntary muscles of the body, especially those that control the eyes, mouth, throat and limbs.
	- Volatile Liquids
		- Isoflurane (Forane)
			- MOA - produces a potent level of surgical anesthesia that is rapid in onset
			- Primary Actions
				- Provides smooth induction with a low degree of metabolism by the body
				- excellent muscle relaxation and may be used off-label as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of status asthmaticus
				- Isoflurane with oxygen or with an oxygen and nitrous oxide mixture may be used
				- does not sensitize the myocardium for dysrhythmias, and it produces fewer cardiovascular effects than other general anesthetics.
			- Alerts
				- Do not use in pregnant
			- Adverse
				- Mild nausea, vomiting, and tremor
				- dose-dependent respiratory depression and a reduction in blood pressure.
				- Malignant hyperthermia with elevated temperature has been reported.
			- Contraindications
				- Do not use for patients with genetic predisposition to malignant hyperthermia
				- Caution: patients with head trauma or brain neoplasms due to possible increases in intracranial pressure

Adjuncts to Anesthesia
Neuromuscular Blockers
Succinylcholine (Anectine, Quelicine)
Class
Skeletal muscle paralytic drug; neuromuscular blocker
Depolarizing blocker; acetylcholine receptor blocking drug
Actions
Like acetylcholine, succinylcholine acts on cholinergic receptor sites at neuromuscular junctions
Effects are first noted as muscle weakness and muscle spasms, eventually, paralysis
rapidly broken down by the enzyme cholinesterase;
when the IV infusion is stopped, the duration of action is only a few minutes
reduces the amount of general anesthetic needed for procedures.
Alerts
Do not administer in pregnant
Adverse
can cause complete paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles
Bradycardia and respiratory depression
High doses: tachycardia, hypotension, and urinary retention.
Contra
Do not use if u have malignant hyperthermia, pulmonary, kidney, cardiovascular, metabolic, or liver dysfunction.
Extreme Caution to - patients with severe burns or trauma, neuromuscular diseases, or glaucoma
