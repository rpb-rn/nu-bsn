Super Cholesterol Fuckers!!! - Statins, Cholestyramine, Fibrates

- **Statins** - HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors
	- ends in “-statins”, statins are not a cure!
	- Prototype Drug:
	- **==atorvastatin (Lipitor)==**
		- Uses
			- Hyperlipidemia => reduce risk of: MI, stroke
			- Prevent: ASCVD (patients with dm, smoking, HTN, fam hx heart disease)
			- Prevent: CAD, stabilize fatty plaques
		- Actions
			- inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase
			- Liver creates less cholesterol
			- less LDL receptors => ↑ removal of chol.
			- 2 weeks before effects are realized
			- need approved exercise program and cardiac diet to maximize therapeutic
		- Contraindications
			- Liver disease, hypersensitivity, pregnant
		- Side Effects
			- Common: GI cramping, diarrhea, constipation
			- Rare: hepatotoxicity, rhabdo
		- Nursing Considerations
			- Monitor liver enzymes : ALT/AST
			- Monitor rhabdo (creatinine kinase - CK)
			- Monitor: glucose
			- No grapefruit, no alcohol
			- Administer with food, breastfeeding not recommended
			- **Mnemonic: “STAT**”
				- Sore muscles
				- Toxic liver
				- Avoid grapefruit + st john’s wort
				- Take at night
- **Bile Acid Sequestrants/Resins**
	- Bile acid resins bind to bile acid => excreted feces=> less bile  
	- => liver uses cholesterol to make more bile => ↓ cholesterol => 🙂
	- Not used as first-line drug for hyperlipidemia (statins are first line) ch. 23.6
		- Cause more adverse effects
		- Interacts with: digoxin and warfarin
		- Used for patients with contraindications for statins
		- Sometimes combined with statins
	- Prototype Drug:
		- **==cholestyramine (Prevalite)==** - “chole” => cholecystitis => gallbladder => bile acid sequestrant
			- Uses
				- reduce the risk for serious ASCVD events
			- Actions
				- Med binds into bile acid in intestine
				- not absorbed or metabolized once it enters the intestine; 
				- does not produce any systemic effects. 
				- may take 30 days or longer to produce its maximum effect.
			- Contraindications
				- Biliary obstruction (note: gallbladder), hypersensitivity
				- Drug Interactions:
				- Do not take: digoxin, tetracyclines, thyroid hormone, statins, thiazide diuretics
			- Side Effects
				- Common: constipation, bloating, gas, and nausea that sometimes limit its use.
				- Interferes with digestion of fats preventing absorption of fat-soluble vitamins - ADEK
					- I’m ADEK-ted to fatties!
			- Nursing Considerations
				- Give other drugs more than 2 hours before or 4 hours after the patient takes this
				- mix with water! Drink ASAP! Separate with other drugs!
				- Increase fiber and fluids, use stool softener, exercise
				- Caution - pregnant
- **Fibric Acid Drugs - Fibrates** 
	- First line of drug for hypertriglyceridemia
	- Prototype Drug:
		- **==gemfibrozil (Lopid)==**
			- Uses
				- For hypertriglyceridemia
				- LESS EFFECTIVE THAN STATINS at lowering LDL
			- Action
				- 50% Reduce VLDL, increase in HDL (unknown mechanism per book)
				- Contraindications
				- Hepatic impairment
				- Severe CKD
				- Gallbladder disease
				- hypersensitivity
			- Drug Interactions
				- May potentiate anticoags
				- With statins: increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis
				- May increase effect of certain DM drugs, statins, insulin
			- Adverse Effects
				- Rare but monitor for: Gallstones, liver function
				- Common: dyspepsia, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain
			- Nursing Considerations
				- Administer 30 minutes prior to morning and evening meals
				- Monitor: CBC, CK, LFT, Serum Glucose

Other Drugs:
Ezetimibe (Zetia)
Use
Lower LDL-C
Combined with statins for increased efficacy
Not to be taken with bile acid sequestrants
Action - blocks cholesterol absorption in small intestine
Drawback: body compensates and produces more cholesterol
Most prescribed nonstatin therapy for lowering LDL
Monitor for:
Hepatotoxicity, CK
Niacin - B3
Use
Lower cholesterol
Decrease VLDL, lowers triglycerides
Less effective than statins, more adverse effects
Adverse
Flushing and hot flashes - your face doesn’t look NICE with NIACIN
GI upset, N/D

Nursing Clinical Judgment: Lipid-Lowering Pharmacotherapy
Recognize and Analyze Cues
Evaluate: liver function and lipid studies
Prioritize and Generate Solutions
If possible, take cholesterol meds at night: cholesterol biosynthesis is at its highest.
Take Action
Adverse Effects
Statins - Report muscle tenderness, pain, numbness, or tingling 
Bile Acids - Report nausea, heartburn, constipation, straining with passing stool, tarry stool, yellowing of sclera
Fibric Acid drugs - RUQ pain, unusual bleeding/bruising, cramping, change in stool color
Monitor glucose for DM
Lifestyle
Encourage intake of omega-3 and CoQ10- rich foods
For long term therapy, ensure intake of fat soluble vitamins - ADEK, folic acid
Evaluate Outcomes
Med effectiveness
Assess total cholesterol, LDL, HDL
Lipid profilles, LFT, CK, uric acid
Administration
Statins: Take with evening meals; avoid grapefruit/juice to prevent toxicity.
Bile acid sequestrants: Take before meals with fluids; mix powders/granules well. Take other meds 2 hours before or 4 hours after.
Niacin: Take with cold water to reduce flushing. Consider 81-325 mg aspirin 30 minutes before.
Fibric acid drugs: Take with meals.
PCSK9 inhibitors: Administer subcutaneously every 2 weeks.
