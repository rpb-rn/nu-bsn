 <br>
<br>Assessment: Evaluate swallowing ability using bedside swallow screening, noting coughing, drooling, or difficulty managing secretions.
<br>Diet Modification: Implement NPO status if aspiration risk is high, then progress to appropriate texture-modified diets (e.g., pureed, mechanical soft) and thickened liquids as ordered.

<br>no thin liquids


<br>Positioning: Keep the patient upright at 90° during meals and for 30-60 minutes after eating to reduce aspiration risk.
<br>Swallowing Techniques: Encourage chin tuck, small bites, slow chewing, and alternate solids with liquids to aid swallowing.
<br>Aspiration Precautions: Monitor for coughing, wet voice, increased secretions, or respiratory distress, and implement suctioning if needed.
<br>Oral Care: Provide frequent oral hygiene to reduce bacterial aspiration pneumonia risk.
<br>Collaboration: Work with speech-language pathology (SLP) for swallowing therapy and further evaluation.
<br>Enteral Nutrition Consideration: If oral intake is unsafe, initiate NG or PEG tube feeding per provider order.

 <br>
<br>GFR measures how well the kidneys are filtering blood, specifically the volume of blood that passes through the glomeruli (kidney's filtering units) per minute.
<br>Normal GFR for a healthy adult is typically around 90–120 mL/min/1.73m², and it can vary based on age, gender, and body size.
<br>A decrease in GFR indicates impaired kidney function, which is crucial in diagnosing and staging Chronic Kidney Disease (<a data-href="CKD" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/GU/CKD.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CKD</a>).
<br><br>Just note that normal GFR is ≥ 90<br>
<br>Guiding Treatment Decisions: Changes in GFR guide adjustments in medication (e.g., dosages of renally cleared drugs) and lifestyle modifications.
<br>Monitoring Complications: Low GFR can lead to complications like fluid retention, electrolyte imbalances, and uremia, all of which require close monitoring and management.
<br>Preventing Progression: Nurses use GFR to track kidney function over time and assess the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., blood pressure control, blood sugar management) in preventing further damage.

 <br>
<br>What is it: Byproduct of anaerobic metabolism produced when oxygen delivery to tissues is insufficient; elevated levels indicate hypoxia or impaired cellular respiration.
<br>Normal Range: 0.5 - 2.2 mmol/L (may vary slightly by lab).
<br>Out of Normal:

<br>Mild Elevation (2.2 - 4 mmol/L): Possible early tissue hypoxia, sepsis, or shock.
<br>Severe Elevation (&gt;4 mmol/L): Suggests significant hypoxia, sepsis, organ dysfunction, or metabolic crisis; often linked to poor prognosis.

<br>Enema: left side, insert 3-4 inches (2-3 for peds), raise 12-18 inches above anus, lubricate 2 inches
<br>Physiotherapy for lower lobe atelectasis: place client in Trendelenburg
<br>IM Injection site:  
<br>Eyedrops: administration: administer on conjunctival sac (not directly on eye)
<br>Tracheostomy care at HOME for caregivers

<br>clean technique is okay


<br>Tracheostomy care 

<br>hydrogen peroxide for cleaning inner canula, pipe cleaners or brush to remove crusties

<br>do not use on SKIN (must be diluted if used on skin)


<br>no cotton balls
<br>80-120mmHg suction pressure for adults, 50-100mmHg peds


<br>Catheter: Male Indwelling

<br>secure on upper thigh or lower abdomen with tape/securement device


<br>Collecting culture from wounds

<br>irrigate with NS prior to collecting
<br>rotate swab back and forth at base of wound to collect pathogens (NOT EDGES of wound)


<br>Enema Types<br>
<br>Cleansing enema - removes feces stimulates peristalsis treats constipation or pre-procedure bowel prep.  
<br>Retention enema - retains solution for prolonged periods for medication absorption or softening stool.  
<br>Oil retention enema - softens stool lubricates rectum for easier defecation.  
<br>Medicated enema - delivers drugs for local or systemic effects such as antibiotics or steroids.  
<br>Carminative enema - relieves gas by stimulating peristalsis and expelling flatus.  
<br>Return-flow enema - relieves gas by repeated instillation and removal of fluid to stimulate peristalsis.  
<br>Hypertonic enema - draws water into the colon by osmosis for rapid evacuation.  
<br>Isotonic enema - saline solution mimics body fluids to soften stool and stimulate evacuation.  
<br>Soap suds enema - irritates mucosa and stimulates peristalsis using soapy water.
<br><br>
<br>Braden Scale: parameters are nutrition, sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, friction and shear
<br>NG Tube Feeding - flush with 30 mL after feeding
<br>Wound Care

<br>Hydrocolloid - best for wounds with minimal/moderate drainage, stage 2 pressure injury
<br>Alginate - for heavy exudate, nonadherent dressings that conform to the wound’s shape and absorb exudate


<br>TPN (nutrition thru IV) - check blood glucose q4, change tubing q24, D10/D20 if nutrition unavailable, check weight daily
<br>Oxygen At Home: do not wear cotton to limit buildup of static (ATI book says cotton is encouraged)
<br>Vest Restraint: tie with quick release knot, allow TWO fingerbreadths between restraints and body, apply restraints over clothing

<br>Initiative vs. Guilt: Preschool (3-6 years) - Encouraging initiative and decision-making; overcontrol can lead to guilt.  
<br>Industry vs. Inferiority: School Age (6-12 years) - Developing competence through learning and achievement; failure results in feelings of inferiority.  
<br>Identity vs. Role Confusion: Adolescence (12-18 years) - Forming a strong sense of self and personal identity; failure leads to confusion about one’s role in life.  
<br>Intimacy vs. Isolation: Young Adulthood (18-40 years) - Establishing meaningful, intimate relationships; failure can lead to isolation and loneliness.  
<br>Generativity vs. Stagnation: Middle Adulthood (40-65 years) - Contributing to society and supporting the next generation; lack of this results in stagnation.  
<br>Integrity vs. Despair: Late Adulthood (65+ years) - Reflecting on life with a sense of fulfillment and acceptance; failure leads to regret and despair.

 <br>
<br>A vasospastic disorder that causes intermittent constriction of small arteries, usually in fingers and toes.    
<br>Triggered by cold exposure or stress, leading to reduced blood flow and color changes.    
<br><br>
<br>Primary Raynaud’s: Idiopathic with no underlying disease.    
<br>Secondary Raynaud’s: Associated with autoimmune conditions (e.g., <a data-href="Scleroderma" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/Immunity &amp; Inflammation/Scleroderma.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Scleroderma</a>, <a data-href="Lupus" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/Immunity &amp; Inflammation/Lupus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lupus</a>, <a data-href="Rheumatoid Arthritis" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/Immunity &amp; Inflammation/Rheumatoid Arthritis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rheumatoid Arthritis</a>).    
<br><br>
<br>Female sex (more common in women ages 15–40).    
<br>Cold environments.    
<br>Family history of Raynaud’s or autoimmune disease.    
<br>Occupational triggers (e.g., vibration tools).    
<br>Smoking (vasoconstriction).    
<br><br>
<br>Triphasic color changes in digits:    

<br>White (pallor) from vasoconstriction.        
<br>Blue (cyanosis) from poor oxygenation.        
<br>Red (rubor) from reperfusion.        


<br>Numbness, tingling, burning pain during or after attacks.    
<br>Cold, pale, or blue fingers/toes, often symmetrical.    
<br><br>
<br>Ulcers or sores on fingers in severe cases.    
<br>Tissue necrosis if blood flow is severely compromised.    
<br>Functional impairment with frequent attacks.    
<br><br>
<br>Clinical history and symptoms during cold/stress exposure.    
<br>Nailfold capillaroscopy to examine capillary structure (esp. in secondary).    
<br>Antibody testing (ANA, anti-centromere) for autoimmune association.    
<br><br>
<br>Lifestyle modifications:    

<br>Avoid cold, wear gloves, keep core warm.        
<br>Manage stress.        
<br>Stop smoking.        


<br>Medications:    

<br>Calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine) – relax vessels.        
<br>Vasodilators (e.g., topical nitroglycerin).        
<br>In secondary cases, treat underlying condition.        


<br>Severe cases:    

<br>Sympathectomy (nerve surgery to reduce spasms).        


<br><br>
<br>Teach cold avoidance strategies and layering clothing.    
<br>Encourage smoking cessation.    
<br>Educate on early symptom recognition and attack prevention.    
<br>Monitor for skin breakdown or signs of ulceration/ischemia.    
<br>In secondary Raynaud’s, coordinate care for underlying autoimmune disease.

<br>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) - broad term involving arteries in heart leading to: either Chronic Stable Angina or ACS
<br> CAD = CSA or ACS<br>Chronic Stable Angina - predictable chest pain during exertion, resolves with rest or nitroglycerin, can progress to unstable<br>
<br>ECG: Normal at rest; ST depression or T wave inversion during stress
<br>Cardiac Biomarkers: normal
<br>Treatment: Lifestyle changes, nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, statins
<br>Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)<br>
<br>sudden, life-threatening condition caused by a sudden reduction in blood flow to the heart
<br>Umbrella term for UA (unstable angina), NSTEMI, and STEMI
<br>ACS = STEMI / NSTEMI / UA<br>STEMI - ischemia causing full-thickness myocardial infarction<br>
<br>cardiac biomarkers: elevated troponin, CK-MB
<br>Treatment: Emergency PCI or thrombolysis, MONA (morphine, oxygen, nitrates, aspirin).
<br>NSTEMI - ischemia with myocardial infarction but without full-thickness injury<br>
<br>caused by-  spasm of artery, stable plaque, a cardiac embolism, or arteritis and injury to the heart
<br>similar to UA but more severe and prolonged, unrelieved by rest or nitroglycerin
<br>Cardiac Biomarkers: Elevated (troponin, CK-MB).
<br>Treatment: Same as UA with emphasis on revascularization (PCI).
<br>Unstable Angina (UA)-  ischemia without myocardial infarction, cardiac markers are NOT elevated.<br>
<br>Occurs at rest, increasing frequency/severity, lasts &gt;20 minutes, unrelieved by nitroglycerin.
<br>Treatment: Antiplatelets (aspirin), anticoagulants, beta-blockers, nitrates, PCI if high risk.
<br>Terms to note:<br>
Infarction - tissue death or necrosis caused by prolonged lack of blood supply<br>
Ischemia - reduced cardiac tissue perfusion, can progress to infarction if unresolved<br>Miscellaneous Things to note:<br>
Prinzmetal angina (vasospastic angina or variant angina) - chest discomfort or pain at rest with transient ECG changes in the ST segment, and with a prompt response to nitroglycerin<br><br>
<br>Atherosclerosis - plaques that narrow or occlude blood flow to coronary arteries, decreasing perfusion
<br>oxygen and nutrient demand outpace supply then causes pain
<br>hypertension, having a sedentary lifestyle, using tobacco or smoking, and by having insulin resistance or diabetes
<br>Non modifiable Risk Factors: Age (45 men, 55 women), Sex, Family history/genetics, race/ethnicity (higher w non-Hispanic white individuals)
<br>Modifiable risk factors: inactivity, poor sleep, vaping/tobacco, obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, stress
<br>Comorbidities: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, thyroid disease, dm, depression, obesity, gout, cancer
<br><br>
<br>Chest discomfort or angina (only when demand is greater than supply)
<br>pain can radiate to the left arm, the neck, jaw, or back
<br>diaphoresis, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, SOB, lightheadedness, and weakness
<br>females may not experience chest pain (may present with extreme fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, and pressure in the chest)
<br><br>Cardiac Biomarkers - detect heart muscle damage<br>
<br>Troponin - peaks in 24-48 hours, protein found in heart muscle, detects myocardial injury, elevated in NSTEMI, STEMI
<br>Creatine Kinase-MB - elevated; enzyme found in the heart muscle, indicates MI
<br>B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) - Primarily used to r/o HF and assess the severity of volume overload or cardiac stress.
<br>C-Reactive Protein (CRP)- Measures inflammation levels; Non-specific, but often elevated in CAD &amp; ACS<br>
Lipoprotein - LDL, HDL (see <a data-href="Lipid Panel" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Foundations/Labs/Lipid Panel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lipid Panel</a>)<br>
Stress Test <br>
<br>evaluate how well the heart functions with activity, diagnose CAD and arrhythmias, evaluate treatment, and determine the risk of having an MI
<br>Exercise Stress Test - exercises on a treadmill or bicycle, with increasing intensity. HR, BP, and EKG are monitored during the test.
<br>stop stress test once chest pain is present
<br>Stress Test Echocardiogram - same as exercise but with echo (U/S)
<br>Nuclear Stress Test - radioactive dye is used during stress test
<br><br>Initial management: MONA (morphine, aspirin, nitro, O2)<br>STEMI<br>
Cardiac Catherization / Coronary Angiogram - diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure; insertion of catheter into a blood vessel<br>
visualize the coronary arteries using contrast dye and X-ray imaging to identify blockages, narrowing, or other abnormalities<br>
used to plan angioplasty, stent placement, or other revascularization procedures.<br>
PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) - non-surgical procedure to treat coronary artery blockages and restore blood flow to the heart<br>
aka Angioplasty<br>
 within 90 minutes, if not: fibrinolysis within 120 minutes<br>
catheter through the skin (usually via the groin or wrist) and threading it to the coronary arteries to open up blockages<br>

 <br><br>
<br>A group of diseases that affect the heart muscle, impairing its ability to pump blood effectively.
<br>Can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
<br>Classification:<br>
Dilated (DCM) - most common<br>
<br>enlargement of the ventricles with reduced systolic function and decreased EF
<br>Causes: Idiopathic, ischemic heart disease, alcohol abuse, viral infections, toxins, genetic mutations
<br>symptoms: chest discomfort, peripheral edema, exponentially increasing levels of fatigue as the condition progresses, and exertional dyspnea.<br>
Hypertrophic (HCM)
<br>thickened ventricular walls, most commonly affecting the interventricular septum, leading to diastolic dysfunction.
<br>causes: Genetic mutations
<br>symptoms: fatigue, syncopal episodes, chest discomfort or palpitations, exhaustion, and dyspnea<br>
Restrictive (RCM)
<br>Stiffened ventricular walls due to fibrosis or infiltration, leading to impaired diastolic filling while systolic function is preserved
<br>poor prognosis; least common
<br>causes: Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, radiation therapy, idiopathic.
<br>symptoms: similar to HF with DCM/HCM<br>
Arrhythmogenic (ACM)
<br>Fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, leading to arrhythmias and structural changes
<br>Causes: Genetic mutations (autosomal dominant), familial
<br>symptoms: ascites, increased JVD, and lethal dysrhythmias, VFib, VTach, including manifestations of other CMs
<br><br>
<br>Fluid overload: <a data-href="Diuretics" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Pharmacology/CardioVascular/Diuretics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diuretics</a> and vasodilators

<br>DCM or RCM: heart transplant, LVAD (left ventricular assist device): can be permanent or temporary fix until transplant
<br>Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): Prevents sudden cardiac death.
<br>Pacemaker: Helps regulate heart rhythm.
<br>septal myectomy - remove portions of hypertrophied ventricular septum
<br>alcohol septal ablation
<br>Lifestyle
<br><br>
<br>fluid restriction: 2L/day
<br>sodium restriction
<br>Lifestyle
<br><br>
<br>Echocardiogram
<br>BNP/NT-proBNP levels (heart failure markers)
<br>Troponin (I and T)- indicates myocardial injury
<br>genetic testing (for familial cases)

<br>Overview: A rapid, abnormal heart rhythm originating in the ventricles, often life-threatening and requiring immediate intervention.
<br>Rate: 100-250 bpm
<br>Rhythm: Regular
<br>P-Waves: Not typically visible or unrelated to QRS complex
<br>QRS Complex: Wide (greater than 0.12 seconds), bizarre shape
<br>PR Interval: Not measurable or absent
<br>Stable VTACH Treatment: minimal symptoms: administer amiodarone or lidocaine (antiarrhythmic drugs), consider cardioversion if drug therapy is ineffective. 
<br>unstable VTACH: immediate synchronized cardioversion or defibrillation if no pulse is present. Consider an ICD (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator) for recurrent episodes.
<br>Symptoms: palpitations, syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath, cardiac arrest, or even sudden cardiac death.
<br>Synchronized Cardioversion<br>
<br>typically less than what is required for defib
<br>set to synchronize =&gt; track R waves
<br>typically 50-100 joules, max 200
<br>Remember: pulseless VT =&gt; defib, CPR, intubate, epi, ami/lido<br>note: VTACH is from ventricles, SVT is from atrium<br>
note: VTACH has wide QRS, SVT has narrow QRS<br>Cardioversion - performed on clients who have a pulse but are not stable hemodynamically; a low energy, synchronous shock that is delivered at the exact point of the QRS complex - R to be exact<br>Note: follow CAB priority framework during CPR<br>Causes: underlying ischemic heart disease, acute MI, dilated cardiomyppathy, e-, structural heart disaese, illicit drug use (meth, coke)<br><br><img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/set-ecg-common-abnormalities-ventricular-260nw-2267147927.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
<br>Overview: A rapid, erratic electrical activity in the ventricles, causing ineffective quivering instead of a coordinated contraction, leading to no pulse and requiring immediate intervention.
<br>Rate: Indeterminate (chaotic electrical activity), 150-500 bpm
<br>Rhythm: Irregular, erratic
<br>P-Waves: None
<br>QRS Complex: None, appears as a chaotic, irregular baseline
<br>PR Interval: None
<br>Treatment: Immediate defibrillation is the primary treatment. Perform CPR until defibrillator is available, followed by epinephrine or amiodarone if necessary. Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols should be followed.
<br>Causes: MI, structural heart disease, e- imbalance: hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypoxia, acidosis, etc<br>Manifestations: sudden collapse due to cardiac arrest, no pulse, unresponsive<br><br><img src="https://www.registerednursern.com/pulseless-electrical-activity-pea-rhythm-ecg/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>

<br>Overview: A condition where there is organized electrical activity on the EKG but no mechanical heart activity or pulse, often associated with cardiac arrest, requiring immediate intervention.
<br>Rate: Varies depending on underlying rhythm
<br>Rhythm: Can be regular or irregular depending on underlying electrical activity
<br>P-Waves: Present or absent, depending on the underlying rhythm
<br>QRS Complex: Present or absent, depending on the underlying rhythm
<br>PR Interval: Present or absent, depending on the underlying rhythm
<br>Treatment: Immediate CPR, administer epinephrine, and correct the underlying cause (e.g., hypoxia, electrolyte imbalances, trauma). Follow ACLS protocols for resuscitation.
<br>Primary Causes: cardiac<br>
Secondary Causes: Hypoxia or resp failure (50% of cases), H's &amp; T's<br>H: hypovolemia, hypoxia, htdrogen ion, hypo/per-kalemia, hypothermia<br>
T: Tension pneumo, trauma, tamponade, thrombosis-pulm, thrombosis-coronary<br>NOTE: for CPR, follow CAB priority framework<br>
<br>Epinephrine 1 mg q3-5 min
<br>amiodarone 300mg or lidocaine 1-1.5 mg/kg
<br><br>
<br>flatline
<br>result of the failure of the intrinsic electrical system of the heart
<br>often result of VFib, pulseless VTach, PEA
<br>also be the result of attempted defibrillation for another dysrhythmia
<br>terminal rhythm
<br>Presentation: no pulse, unresponsive, flatline EKG<br>Treatment:<br>
<br>Asystole is a non-shockable rhythm!
<br>intubation of the airway
<br>CPR (with minimal interruption of &lt; 5 seconds)
<br>IV epinephrine (ideally within 5 minutes of the start of cardiac arrest) followed by 1 mg every 3 to 5 minutes.
<br><br>
<br>A conduction delay at the AV node resulting in prolonged PR interval without dropped beats; generally asymptomatic and often benign.
<br>Rate: Usually normal
<br>Rhythm: Regular
<br>P-Waves: Present, one for each QRS complex
<br>PR Interval: Prolonged (&gt;0.20 seconds) but consistent
<br>QRS Complex: Normal (0.06-0.10 seconds)
<br>Treatment: Typically no treatment required unless symptomatic. Monitor for progression to higher-degree blocks. Address underlying causes such as medication effects, electrolyte imbalances, or ischemia.
<br><br><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lGTjE6jE3P4/maxresdefault.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br>
Longer, longer, longer, drop! Then you have a WENCKEBACH<br>
<br>Overview: A progressive delay in AV node conduction until a QRS complex is dropped; often transient and may not require treatment.
<br>Rate: Usually normal or slightly slow
<br>Rhythm: Irregular due to dropped beats
<br>P-Waves: Present, with more P-waves than QRS complexes
<br>QRS Complex: Normal (0.06-0.10 seconds)
<br>PR Interval: Progressively lengthens until a QRS complex is dropped
<br>Treatment: Typically no intervention if asymptomatic. If symptomatic (e.g., dizziness, syncope), consider atropine (for brady) or temporary pacing. Monitor closely for progression to a higher-degree block.
<br>Causes: medications sch as CCBs, beta-blockers, digitalis, amiodarone, adenosine, increase in vagal tone, post cardiac surgery, e- imbalance, cardiomyopathies, hyperkalemia, MI, myocarditis<br>Presentation:  no physical manifestations, and minimal hemodynamic alterations<br><br>If some P’s don’t get through, then you have MOBITZ II<br>
<br>Overview: A more serious block where some P-waves are not conducted to the ventricles without a progressive PR interval change; higher risk of progressing to third-degree block.
<br>Location: bundle of His, bundle branches, or fascicles (basically the ventricles)
<br>Rate: Usually slow, depending on the number of dropped beats
<br>Rhythm: Regular or irregular (based on conduction pattern)
<br>P-Waves: Present, with more P-waves than QRS complexes
<br>QRS Complex: Often widened (&gt;0.12 seconds) if block occurs below the AV node
<br>PR Interval: Constant in conducted beats (no progressive lengthening)
<br>Treatment: Permanent pacemaker placement is often indicated due to risk of progression to complete heart block. Temporary pacing is done while waiting. 
<br>Other info:<br>
<br>Causes: MI, necrosis in heart, e-, CCBs, betablockers, amiodarone, digoxin, adenosine, post cardiac surgery
<br>Patho: block in conduction system (usually bundle of HIS or bundle branches)
<br>Presentation: bradycardia, fatigue, syncope, dyspnea, dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, and nausea
<br>Things to note<br>
<br>if caused by meds, stop those meds
<br>there is increased risk for falls d/t fatigue, dizziness, SOB
<br><br>If P’s and Q’s don’t agree, then you have a THIRD DEGREE<br>
<br>Overview: A complete heartblock! Total disruption of electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles, causing them to beat independently; a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.
<br>Rate: Atrial rate typically normal, ventricular rate slow (usually &lt; 40 bpm)
<br>Rhythm: Regular, but atrial and ventricular rhythms are independent
<br>P-Waves: Present, unrelated to QRS complexes (no consistent PR interval)
<br>QRS Complex: May be narrow or wide depending on the location of the block
<br>PR Interval: Variable with no consistent relationship between P-waves and QRS complexes
<br>Treatment: Immediate intervention required; temporary transcutaneous pacing followed by permanent pacemaker placement is the primary treatment. Administer atropine or epinephrine if symptomatic while awaiting pacing
<br>manifestations: varies: bradycardia, chest pain, shortness of breath, generalized fatigue, or syncope, altered LOC, JVD<br>bradycardic manifestations: decompensated heart failure, decreased capillary refill, cool skin, diaphoresis, altered mental status, tachypnea, cool skin, retraction, and respiratory distress <br>Things to note:<br>
<br>increased risk for falls
<br>increased risk for nausea and aspiration
<br>Atropine is for bradycardia since 3rd Degree blocks feature a ventricular escape rhythm (which is slower)
<br>Amiodarone is for tachyarrhythmias (AFIB, VT, VF)
<br><br>
<br>post-op: avoid strenuous activity, keep arm immobilized
<br>do not drive for 2-3 weeks
<br>use arm sling during night time (and during day if possible)
<br>do not move arm above shoulder level
<br>wear medical alert bracelet
<br>beware of magnets, large motors, radars, MRIs
<br>no contact sports
<br>keep cellphones at least 6 inches
<br>regular monitoring of function, battery life, identified abnormal rhythms

<br>insertion of catheter in peripheral art (usually radial, femoral, brachial), see trends or abrupt changes in BP, frequent lab draws
<br>transducer must be positioned at the level of the midaxillary line at the level of the right atrium when lying in bed
<br>too low: high pressure, too high - low pressure =&gt; all wrong
<br>manual blood pressures can be unsafe due to sudden hemodynamic changes
<br><br>
<br>catheter is inserted through the brachial, antecubital, jugular, or femoral vein to connect with the right side of the heart and then proceed to the pulmonary artery
<br>for patients who have cardiogenic shock, pulmonary hypertension, and unexplained dyspnea
<br>Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP) - measure of the pressure in the small blood vessels (capillaries) that lie between the lungs and the left atrium. Reflects left atrial pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP); indicates left heart function and fluid status. Normal Range: 6-12 mmHg.<br>
Normal Range: 6-12 mmHg<br><br>
<br>pressure in the superior vena cava or right atrium; reflects right ventricular preload and fluid status.
<br>Normal Range: 8 and 12 mm Hg.
<br>central venous access device (CVAP), generally inserted in the internal jugular or subclavian vein and advanced into the superior vena cava at the entrance to the right atrium. 
<br>Decreases in CVP can be an indication of hypovolemia, blood loss greater than 10%, dilation of the vena cava, or a decrease in intrathoracic pressure
<br>Elevations in CVP can indicate decreased cardiac contractility, dysrhythmias, or abnormal functioning of the cardiac valves, all of which may indicate heart failure

 <br><br>Shock<br>
<br>life-threatening condition that occurs as a result of circulatory failure
<br>causes decreased SVR and perfusion 
<br>leads to tissue hypoxia, cellular death, and organ dysfunction
<br>4 Main Types:<br>
<br>Distributive (septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic, toxic) =&gt; vasodilation
<br>Cardiogenic
<br>Hypovolemic
<br>Obstructive
<br>Common Manifestations: tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, abnormal mental status, mottled skin, cold and clammy extremities, oliguria, hyperlactatemia, and metabolic acidosis<br><br>
<br>Systemic vasodilation
<br>results in decreased perfusion the heart, brain, and kidneys =&gt; eventually organ damage
<br>Capillary fluid leaks into the surrounding tissue causing further clinical deterioration with decreased systemic vascular resistance and abnormal oxygen utilization.
<br>decreased CO, hypotension
<br>Subtypes: septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic, toxic
<br>risk factors: <a data-href="CKD" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/GU/CKD.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CKD</a>, lots of lines, immunosuppression, recent surgery, old, cancer
<br><br>
<br>release of inflammatory cytokines in the presence of sepsis
<br>cytokines damage blood vessel walls, triggering clotting and forming tiny clots
<br>fluid leaks!
<br>Causes: pancreatitis, burns, HAI
<br>Treatment: abx within 1 hour, IVF (crystalloid - Salt solutions used for fluid replacement that can easily move around the body), norepi to manage BP
<br>Resus: 3-mL/kg first 3 hours of resus
<br><br>
<br>severe hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by IgE
<br>results in the release of chemical mediators such as histamines, prostaglandins, leukotrienes
<br>increases vascular permeability and subsequent decreased SVR, vasodilation, decreased perfusion to vital organs, and bronchoconstriction
<br>Causes: exposure to an allergen (foods, latex, medications, animal venom, insect stings)
<br>signature cue: exposure to an allergen such as medication, food, or insect sting
<br>Manifestations: flushing, edema of the face and mouth, urticaria, hypotension, hoarseness, facial and oral edema, tachypnea, wheezing or stridor
<br>FIRST LINE TX: IM EPI (give first before anything else), keep repeating until symptoms resolve =&gt; hold epi in muscle for 10 sec
<br>remove cause of allergic rxn, IVF (crystalloids), corticosteroids, antihistamines, albuterol
<br>Scenario: if giving abx &amp; patient complains of itchiness and difficulty breathing, do the ff: 1. stop meds, 2. auscultate lungs, 3. epi
<br><br>
<br>due to autonomic dysregulation caused by a primary and secondary spinal cord injury above the level of T6,
<br>often associated with trauma to the cervical or thoracic vertebrae.
<br>Primary injury: damage to axons, grey mater, and the anterior root
<br>Secondary injury: causes electrolyte shifts, edema, and a vascular insult that leads to necrosis of the grey matter.
<br>Causes: trauma, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, spinal anesthesia
<br>Manifestations: brady cardia = unique symptom, flushed and warm skin, autonomic dysreflexia, temperature dysregulation, orthostatic hypotension, and bradyarrhythmias
<br>Tx: IV NS ASAP
<br><br>
<br>involves infection from Staphylococcus aureus and endotoxins from group A streptococcus
<br>often resulting from the use of nasal or vaginal tampons
<br>Other causes: burns, soft tissue or post-surgical infections, and dialysis catheters
<br>manifestations: hypotension, rash resembling a sunburn, fever, and ultimately organ-failure related to vascular permeability.
<br><br>
<br>intravascular volume is decreased, resulting in poor CO
<br>result of blood loss or extracellular fluid loss
<br>25-30% loss of volume
<br>Hemorrhagic shock - insufficient perfusion of blood
<br>inadequate O2 demands =&gt; anaerobic metabolism, by-product: lactic acid (leads to lactic acidosis =&gt; decreased cardiac contractility)
<br>Coagulopathy: impaired coagulation as a result of blood loss
<br>Signature cue: flattened neck veins and orthostatic hypotension
<br>low central venous pressure (normal is 2-6 mmHg)
<br>risk factors: trauma, <a data-href="Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/Cardiovascular/Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</a>, PUD, maternal clients with bleeding risk
<br>Nursing intervention: lower HOB (more perfusion to brain and core)
<br>Note: infuse NS first before vasopressors (do not infuse vasopressors first!)
<br>Put SPO2 on forehead instead of extremities for more accurate
<br>Volume Loss Manifestations by %<br>
&lt;20% loss - anxiety, restlessness<br>
20-40% loss - tachycardia, tachypnea, oliguria (dec. UOP), and orthostatic hypotension<br>
40%+ loss: hypotension, severe tachycardia, and deteriorating mental status<br>Other manifestations: muscle cramps, thirst, abdominal or chest pain, lethargy, agitation, or confusion, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, cyanosis<br>Internal bleeding symptoms: hematemesis, bloody stool, and abdominal distention<br>Hemorrhagic Causes: trauma, rupture of esophageal varices GI bleed, aneurysm rupture, anticoags<br>
Non-Hemorrhagic causes: excessive diuresis, burns, GI fluid loss, third spacing (ascites, edema, pleural effusion, interstitial shift)<br>Treatment: determine if hemorrhagic or not ASAP<br>
Hemorrhagic: stop the bleed, administer blood products (PRBCs), FFP, plasma, large bor IV<br>
Non-hemo:  rapid infusion of warm isotonic crystalloids for a total of 30 mL/kg<br>do not give vasopressors in hypovolemic shock =&gt; it can worsen tissue perfusion (if given, infuse NS first)<br><br>
<br>Cardiac dysfunction causes myocardial ischemia =&gt; less CO =&gt; hypoperfusion
<br>Compensatory mechanisms: peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia
<br>Signature cues: chest pain and cardiac arrhythmias, narrowed pulse pressure, rhonchi, and distended jugular veins with elevated pulsations.
<br>Causes: PE, metabolic acidosis, e- imbalance, cardiac nature
<br>risk factors: 75 older, asian, pacific islander, female, DM, CVD, sepsis, obese
<br>Signature manifestations: chest pain, arrhythmias, narrowed pulse pressure, ronchi, distented JV with pulsations
<br>tx: goal is to restore optimal CO; vasopressors (norepi), inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone), IVF, treat cause or mechanical support
<br>Positive Inotropic = more forceful beats, Double D's = Digoxin &amp; Dopamine
<br>Note: Dopamine can cause Tachycardia and Arrythmias (lower dose if this happens)
<br>MCS: mechanical circulatory support. Examples: LVAD, balloon pump (IABP), ECMO, cardiac transplant<br><br>
<br>blood flow is blocked and circulation to the major organs is disrupted
<br>examples: pulmonary embolism, tension pneumo, mechanical ventilation with high levels of PEEP
<br>other examples: aortic dissection, pericardiac tamponade, pericardiac effusion, mass within heart
<br>other Causes: tension pneumo, ventilation high VEEP, PE

<br>Initial Stage

<br>Patho: Cellular hypoxia leads to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid buildup
<br>S/S: Often subtle; possible mild tachycardia and cool extremities


<br>Compensatory Stage

<br>Patho: Body activates compensatory mechanisms (SNS activation, RAAS system) to maintain perfusion, "FIGHT OR FLIGHT", peripheral vasoconstriction
<br>S/S: Tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, cool/clammy skin, decreased urine output, altered mental status.


<br>Progressive Stage

<br>Patho: Compensatory mechanisms fail, resulting in worsening hypoxia and cellular dysfunction
<br>S/S: Hypotension, weak pulses, severe confusion, anuria, metabolic acidosis, cold and clammy skin is priority in this stage

<br>dry inside - diabetes insipidus
<br>same amount of kool aid powder but with too little water = the juice is too concentrated &amp; has too much flavor (hypernatremia, high serum osmolality)
<br>low release of antidiuretic hormone (aka vasopressin) =&gt; patient keeps peeing nonstop!
<br>key e-: Na
<br>2 Types:<br>
<br>Central DI - neuro, trauma, less common
<br>Nephrogenic DI - kidneys develop resistance to ADH, more common
<br>Less common: gestational DI<br><br>
<br>Central DI =&gt; brain issue: tumor, bran surgery, infection in CNS =&gt; hypothalamus or pituitary gland
<br>Nephrogenic =&gt; caused by gene mutations, renal diseases, pregnancy, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, meds (lithium, abx, antifungals, antineoplastics)
<br>congenital - rare (affects hypothalamus)
<br>autoimmune or vascular diseases
<br>sarcoidosis
<br>ischemia
<br><br>
<br>any condition related to injury of hypothalamus or pituitary: neurosurgery, infection, genetic disorder
<br>damage to kidneys (lithium, amphotericin B, demeclocycline) =&gt; stop meds right away
<br>gestational DI =&gt; pregnancy
<br>MS - dipsogenic DI (excessive thirst)
<br><br>
<br>thirst does not go away =&gt; polydipsia
<br>polyuria - excessive urinating
<br>nocturia
<br>HIGH SODIUM &gt; leads to excessive thirst; hypernatremia
<br><br>
<br>patients who have no thirst perception have greater risk
<br>increased risk for skin impairment due to nocturia
<br><br>
<br>nocturia - urination at night, less sleep
<br>higher risk for mortality d/t fever, dehydration, hypernatremia, cv complication
<br><br>
<br>Serum ADH less than 1, =&gt; nephrogenic, more than 5= central (normal is 1 to 5 ng/L)
<br>diluted urine - urine osmolality is low (normal average is 500-900; anything under 300 is DI)
<br>Urine Specific Gravity confirms DI: Less than 1.005 (normal range is 1.005-1.03)
<br>Urine sodium 24 hours - less than 40 mg/day
<br>look for UOP of greater than 3L/day
<br>water deprivation test <br>
<br>differentiates between central and nephrogenic
<br>stimulates secretion of ADH
<br>DI: urine osmolality does not increase over 300 mosm/kg 
<br>Nurse task: ensure water is withheld
<br>body weight and urine osmolality are measured HOURLY
<br>Other Lab Tests considered:<br>
<br>Serum sodium, osmolality
<br>urine 
<br>BUN
<br><br>
<br>Central DI: desmopressin - an analog of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and the hormone replacement of choice for diabetes insipidus; REABSORBS WATER IN KIDNEYS
<br>most effective route for desmopressin: intranasal 5-10 mcg at bedtime
<br>other drugs to increase ADH: carbamazepine, chlorpropamide
<br>Thiazide Diuretics: usually with nephrogenic (sometimes in central DI); thiazides induce mild hypovolemia which results in less urine output eventually, thus retain more water
<br>renal diet
<br>Dextrose or any hypOtonic fluids =&gt; 500-750mL/hr infusion rate (NOTE: DO NOT INFUSE HYPERTONIC!)
<br>Adverse reactions of desmopressin: hyponatremia, palpitations, tachycardia, headache, rhinitis, nasal congestion, pruritus, edema of the eyes<br><br>
<br>indwelling catheter is usually indicated =&gt; strict I/O

<br>T3/T4 is HIGH = HYperthyroidism
<br>T3/T4 causes increased expression of B-adrenergic receptors (causing increased FIGHT OR FLIGHT response)
<br><br>
<br>Graves' disease (autoimmune, most common) - immune system gets confused and tells thyroid to go wild, making you jittery, sweaty, and giving you bulging eyes (grave's ophthalmopathy)
<br>Toxic multinodular goiter - lumps (nodules) on your thyroid start making too much thyroid hormone
<br>Thyroid adenoma (benign tumor)

 <br>
<br>Four small glands located behind the thyroid in the neck    
<br>Despite the name, not part of the thyroid — totally separate job!    
<br><br>
<br>Releases parathyroid hormone (PTH)    
<br>PTH’s job = regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the blood    
<br><br>
<br>Increases calcium in blood by:    

<br>Breaking down bone (releasing calcium)        
<br>Telling kidneys to keep calcium (reabsorption)        
<br>Helping intestines absorb more calcium (by activating vitamin D)     


<br>Lowers phosphate levels (via kidney excretion)    
<br><br><br>
<br>Too much PTH → high calcium (hypercalcemia)    
<br>Symptoms: "bones, stones, groans, moans"    

<br>Bone pain, kidney stones, GI upset, fatigue/confusion        


<br><br>
<br>Too little PTH → low calcium (hypocalcemia)    
<br>Symptoms: muscle cramps, tetany, Chvostek’s &amp; Trousseau’s signs    
<br><br>
<br>PTH = Pulls The calcium Higher    
<br>HypOcalcemia = twitchy/Overactive nerves

<br>Physical examination (may reveal hepatomegaly, or liver enlargement)
<br>Blood tests:

<br>Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT)
<br>Lipid profile (elevated cholesterol or triglycerides)
<br>Fasting blood glucose (to assess for insulin resistance)


<br>Ultrasound: Most common test to identify fatty liver
<br>CT scan or MRI: Can provide a more detailed view of the liver
<br>Liver biopsy: May be needed in cases of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) to assess liver damage
<br>Elastography: Measures liver stiffness to evaluate for fibrosis or cirrhosis
<br><br>
<br>Lifestyle changes:

<br>inflammation of the liver
<br><br>
<br>Viral hepatitis: Caused by Hep ABCDE
<br>Autoimmune hepatitis: Immune system attacks liver cells (less common)
<br>Toxic hepatitis: Due to alcohol, drugs, or toxins. (less common)
<br>Metabolic hepatitis: Related to fatty liver diseases (e.g., MASLD).
<br>constant irritation causes cells to necrotize and eventually form scar tissues =&gt; <a data-href="Cirrhosis" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/GI/Hepatic/Cirrhosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cirrhosis</a>(complication)
<br>Hepatitis Virus - ABCDE<br>
<br>most common: ABC
<br>A = ass to mouth (oral-fecal)
<br>B &amp; C = blood and cum (bloodborne &amp; sexual transmission)
<br>D = double dip (needs B infection first)
<br>E = exit through the ass (oral-fecal)
<br><br>
<br>vary depending on type
<br>A &amp; E- poor sanitation, oral-fecal route, close contact, drug use, seggs, travel to endemic areas, contaminated food
<br>B - unprotected seggs, multiple partners (ho life), needles, mother to child, healthcare workers, tattoos, close proximity
<br>C = same as B, lower risk from seggs
<br>Common risk factors: older adults, immunocompromised, alcohol abuse, preexisting liver conditions
<br><br>
<br>jaundice of eyes and skin = buildup of bilirubin 
<br>N/V
<br>abdominal pain, swelling
<br>fever, fatigue, loss of appetite
<br>dark urine = bilirubin in urine
<br>clay-colored stool (white or gray  shit =&gt; lack of bile = no bilirubin as it is normally excreted in stool)
<br>pruritus - buildup of bile salts in skin
<br>muscle/joint pain = B/C
<br>SEVERE: significant weight loss, uncontrolled N/V, confusion/drowsiness, bruising easily, severe abdominal pain
<br><br>

<br>Liver Failure
<br>fulminant liver failure - hepatic encephalopathy, occurs abruptly 
<br>Bleeding disorders - coagulopathy (Vitamin K is stored and activated in liver)
<br>liver cancer
<br>hepatic encephalopathy - severe; toxins cannot be excreted by liver
<br>Portal Hypertension
<br>a lot more
<br><br>
<br><a data-href="LFT" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Foundations/Labs/LFT.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">LFT</a> = elevated
<br>serum antibodies to specify which type =&gt; guides treatment decisions
<br>Imaging: US, CT, MRI
<br>Liver biopsy 
<br>Elastography - noninvasive alternative to biopsy that measures liver stiffness (stiff = fibrosis)
<br><a data-href="Coags" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Foundations/Labs/Coags.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coags</a> = liver is responsible for clotting factors
<br><br>
<br>Hepatitis A = no treatment; supportive care only; resolves on its own
<br>B &amp; C = interferon for 6 months (proteins produced naturally by immune system for viruses)
<br>Direct Acting Antivirals = Hep C
<br>not allowed: alcohol, tylenol
<br><br>
<br>risk for malnutrition (sarcopenia = loss of muscle from low protein intake)
<br>encourage smaller more frequent meals to reduce upset stomach
<br>Ascites = compute caloric calculations with ideal weight instead of including ascites weight
<br>risk for hyponatremia = very common
<br>risk for thrombocytopenia = low platelets, BLEEDING PRECAUTIONS, no shaving, no hard-bristle toothbrush or dental floss, no aspirin/NSAID, check for signs of bleeding, falls precautions
<br>Educate on diet
<br>encourage vaccination
<br>encourage handwashing
<br>no seggs
<br>use needleless systems if possible
<br>report all cases of virus to health department
<br><br>
<br>Chronic Liver Disease - umbrella term that includes hepatitis, steatotic liver disease (SLD), cirrhosis, carcinoma, liver failure
<br>Steatotic Liver Disease - aka <a data-href="Fatty Liver - Steatotic Liver Disease" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/GI/Hepatic/Fatty Liver - Steatotic Liver Disease.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fatty Liver - Steatotic Liver Disease</a>, also includes alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD),&nbsp;metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and MetALD (a combination of MASLD and ALD).​​​​​​​
<br><br>
<br>Risk for Bleeding: Impaired liver function reduces clotting factors, increasing bleeding risk.
<br>Fluid Volume Excess: Ascites and edema from portal hypertension and decreased albumin.
<br>Imbalanced Nutrition: Less than Body Requirements: Inadequate intake and malabsorption due to liver dysfunction.
<br>Risk for Infection: Impaired immune function and potential for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhosis.
<br>Acute Pain: Abdominal discomfort from liver inflammation, ascites, or liver capsule distension.
<br>Disturbed Thought Processes: Hepatic encephalopathy from toxin buildup affecting brain function.
<br>Fatigue: Decreased liver function and metabolic changes cause physical exhaustion.
<br>Impaired Skin Integrity: Risk of skin breakdown from edema, pruritus, or jaundice.
<br>Risk for Impaired Liver Function: Further liver damage due to ongoing inflammation, alcohol, or medication use.
<br>Anxiety: Psychological stress from chronic illness, uncertainty, and potential complications.

 <br>
<br>What is it: little pockets in your gut that get inflamed (diverticula) that form in the walls of the colon, typically in the sigmoid colon, occur in areas of weakness along the intestinal tract
<br>Causes: Fecal matter or bacteria becoming trapped in the diverticula, leading to inflammation or infection
<br>Risk Factors: constant straining (chronic constipation) =&gt; more pressure, age, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, low fiber diet, steroids, opioids, NSAIDS
<br>Clinical Manifestations: abdominal pain, fever, N/V, bloating, tenderness, possible rectal bleeding
<br>Diagnosis: CT, CBC (infection), colonoscopy (r/o other conditions)
<br>Treatment: abx, NPO (bowel rest) followed by clear liquid diet, <a data-href="Analgesia" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Pharmacology/Analgesia/Analgesia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Analgesia</a> but no NSAIDS, surgery for complications (perforations, abscess, fistulas)
<br><br>
<br>avoid NSAIDS
<br>assess bowel sounds
<br>hydrate
<br>avoid enemas and laxatives during inflammation
<br>avoid seeds, nuts, popcorn
<br>if no inflammation, high fiber diet is encouraged
<br><br>
<br>Nuts and Seeds: These can get trapped in the diverticula and cause irritation or infection (though current research suggests this may not always be true for everyone).
<br>Popcorn: Similar to nuts and seeds, popcorn kernels can irritate diverticula.
<br>Corn: Whole kernels can potentially get stuck in diverticula and cause issues.
<br>Fruits and Vegetables with Small Seeds: Such as strawberries, raspberries, and tomatoes, which might irritate the diverticula.
<br>Spicy Foods: Can irritate the digestive tract and increase inflammation.
<br>High-Fat Foods: Fried foods, fatty meats, and full-fat dairy can slow digestion and worsen symptoms.
<br>Refined Grains: White bread, pasta, and rice lack fiber and may worsen constipation, increasing pressure on the colon.
<br>Processed Meats: Bacon, sausage, and other high-fat, processed meats can contribute to inflammation.

 <br><br>
<br>What is it: classified under the umbrella term known as an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
<br>may demonstrate patches of inflammation followed by patches of healthy tissue
<br>Causes: Exact cause unknown; likely involves immune system dysfunction, genetic predisposition, and environmental triggers.
<br>Risk Factors: Family history, smoking, high-fat diet, NSAID use, stress, and exposure to Westernized diet/lifestyle.
<br>Clinical Manifestations: Abdominal pain (usually RLQ), chronic diarrhea (sometimes bloody), weight loss, fatigue, malnutrition, fever, oral ulcers, and perianal disease (fissures, abscesses, fistulas).
<br>Diagnosis: colonoscopy with biopsy, CT, MRI, fecal calprotectin (inflammation marker), blood tests (elevated CRP, anemia, vitamin deficiencies).
<br>Treatment: Anti-inflammatory meds (<a data-href="5-ASA" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Pharmacology/GI Meds/5-ASA.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">5-ASA</a>, corticosteroids), immunosuppressants (azathioprine, methotrexate), biologics (TNF inhibitors like infliximab), antibiotics for infections, surgery if complications arise (resections, fistula repair).
<br>Nursing Considerations: Monitor for malnutrition, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances; provide dietary support (low-fiber during flares, high-calorie/protein intake); assess for medication side effects (infection risk with immunosuppressants); encourage smoking cessation and stress management. Watch for complications like strictures, perforation, and abscesses.
<br><br>
<br>What is it: also under IBD, continuous inflammation and ulcers in the colon and rectum.
<br>Causes: Unknown; thought to involve genetic, immune, and environmental factors.
<br>Risk Factors: Family history, autoimmune disorders, high-fat diet, smoking (increased risk in non-smokers).
<br>Clinical Manifestations: cramping, urgency, tenesmus, weight loss, fatigue, fever, anemia, sores can bleed = bloody diarrhea
<br>Diagnosis: Colonoscopy with biopsy (shows continuous inflammation, ulcers), stool tests, blood tests (elevated CRP, anemia).
<br>Treatment: Anti-inflammatory meds (<a data-href="5-ASA" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Pharmacology/GI Meds/5-ASA.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">5-ASA</a>), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics (TNF inhibitors), surgery (colectomy if severe).
<br>Nursing Considerations: Monitor for dehydration, malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances. Assess for complications (toxic megacolon, perforation).

<br>most common; gallbladder becomes inflamed due to an obstruction caused by a gallstone that may prevent the bile from being expelled 
<br> ACALCULOUS <br>
<br>sudden inflammation of the gallbladder w/o gallstones
<br>more life threatening! high risk of perforation and necrosis that occurs more often in critically ill clients 
<br>dysfunction of the gallbladder emptying mechanism related to prolonged periods without oral feeding
<br>usually accompanied by severe trauma, burns, sepsis or other major complication
<br>Causes: <br>
<br>gallstones (calculous cholecystitis) obstructing the cystic duct, leading to bile stasis and infection
<br>bacterial infection, ischemia, trauma, prolonged fasting, critical illness.
<br>Risk Factors: Female, obesity, high-fat diet, rapid weight loss, pregnancy, hormone therapy, older age, diabetes, prolonged TPN use.<br>Clinical Manifestations: RUQ pain, radiates to right shoulder, worsens after fatty meals, N/V, fever, tachycardia, Murphy’s sign positive, possible jaundice if bile duct obstructed.<br>Blumberg's sign -  sharp pain that occurs when pressure is released from the abdomen during a physical examination (ATI)<br>Diagnosis: Ultrasound (first-line), HIDA scan, CT scan, elevated WBC, LFTs (bilirubin, ALP), amylase/lipase if pancreatic involvement.<br>Treatment:<br>

<br>abx
<br>cholecystectomy (laparoscopic preferred) - The surgical excision of the gallbladder.
<br>ERCP if bile duct obstruction present.
<br>Nursing Considerations: <br>
<br>Monitor for infection
<br>pain control
<br>NPO status
<br>IV hydration
<br>post-op care after cholecystectomy (early ambulation, wound care
<br>educate on diet modifications (low-fat, small meals).
<br>Things to note:<br>
Murphy's Sign - when you press on the RUQ and the patient experiences pain<br>
ERCP - Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography; a medical procedure that combines endoscopy and X-rays to diagnose and treat conditions affecting the bile ducts<br>
ERCP is used to remove gallstones<br>
MRCP - Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, another imaging procedure<br>
Estrogen - fucks up the gallbladder resulting in decreased production of bile salts =&gt; clumping of bile =&gt; blockage<br>
HIDA scan - dye is injected to trace movement in bile ducts, Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid Scan, uses special camera<br><br>What is it: gallstones formed from cholesterol, bilirubin, or mixed substances in the gallbladder, can be asymptomatic or cause obstruction leading to cholecystitis.<br>
Causes: Imbalance in bile composition (excess cholesterol, bilirubin, or decreased bile salts), bile stasis, gallbladder motility issues.<br>
Risk Factors: Female, obesity, high-fat/low-fiber diet, rapid weight loss, pregnancy, hormone therapy, older age, diabetes, liver disease, prolonged TPN.<br>
Clinical Manifestations: Asymptomatic or biliary colic (RUQ pain, radiates to right shoulder, postprandial, especially after fatty meals), nausea, vomiting, bloating, dyspepsia.<br>
Diagnosis: Ultrasound (first-line), CT scan, MRCP, elevated LFTs if bile duct obstruction, ERCP if common bile duct stones suspected.<br>
Treatment: Asymptomatic—no treatment needed; symptomatic—cholecystectomy (laparoscopic preferred), bile acid dissolution therapy (ursodiol) if surgery contraindicated, ERCP for bile duct stones.<br>
Nursing Considerations: Pain management, monitor for signs of obstruction or infection, educate on diet changes (low-fat, small meals), post-op care after cholecystectomy, assess for complications like pancreatitis or cholangitis.]]></description><link>https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/GI/Cholecystitis.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Med-Surg/GI/Cholecystitis.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RPB]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 18:19:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dumping Syndrome]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>
<br>A condition where food moves too quickly from the stomach into the small intestine, causing fluid shifts and hormonal responses.    
<br>Common after gastric surgery (e.g., gastrectomy, gastric bypass).    
<br><br>
<br>Gastric surgery (partial or total gastrectomy, gastric bypass, vagotomy).    
<br>Rapid gastric emptying due to loss of normal pyloric control.    
<br>High-sugar meals, which pull fluid into the intestine, worsening symptoms.    =&gt; AVOID HIGH CARB
<br><br>
<br>History of gastric surgery.    
<br>High-carbohydrate diet.    
<br>Small stomach size or altered digestion due to surgery.    
<br><br>Early Dumping Syndrome (Within 30 Minutes of Eating)<br>
<br>Abdominal cramping, bloating, nausea.    
<br>Diarrhea (due to rapid fluid shift into intestines).    
<br>Tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness (from fluid loss and vasodilation). 
<br>Diaphoresis (sweating).
<br>Late Dumping Syndrome (1-3 Hours After Eating)<br>
<br>Rebound hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin release.    
<br>Weakness, dizziness, confusion.    
<br>Sweating, shakiness, palpitations.    
<br><br>
<br>Severe dehydration from diarrhea.    
<br>Malnutrition and weight loss due to food avoidance.    
<br>Hypoglycemia from late-phase insulin surge.    
<br><br>
<br>Glucose tolerance test – Identifies late dumping syndrome.    
<br>Gastric emptying study – Confirms rapid emptying.    
<br>Clinical history and symptom pattern.    
<br><br>
<br>Dietary modifications:    

<br>Eat small, frequent meals.        
<br>Avoid high-carb foods (especially simple sugars).        
<br>Increase protein and healthy fats to slow digestion.        
<br>Drink fluids between meals, not with meals.        
<br>Lie down after eating to slow gastric emptying.        


<br>Medications:    

<br>Acarbose (delays carbohydrate absorption, prevents hypoglycemia).        
<br>Octreotide (reduces gastric motility).        


<br>Surgical options (rarely needed):    

<br>Reconstructive surgery to slow gastric emptying.        


<br><br>
<br>Monitor for dehydration (tachycardia, hypotension).    
<br>Educate on dietary changes to prevent symptoms.    
<br>Assess blood sugar levels for hypoglycemia.    
<br>Encourage rest after meals to reduce rapid dumping.

<br>Location: Gastric ulcer affects the stomach; ulcerative colitis affects the colon and rectum.
<br>Cause: Gastric ulcer is mainly due to acid damage; ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune condition.
<br>Symptoms: Gastric ulcer pain is meal-related; ulcerative colitis presents with chronic diarrhea and blood in stool.
<br>Treatment Approach: Gastric ulcer focuses on acid suppression; ulcerative colitis requires immune modulation.
<br><br>
<br>open sores that occur in the inner lining of the stomach
<br>ATI says they are synonymous with PEPTIC ULCERS or PUD
<br>damaged  protective mucosa is exposed to gastric juices =&gt; stomach tissue is dissolved (severe pain)
<br>H. pylori colonizes mucosa causing inflammation and increased acidity
<br><br>
<br>H.Pylori Infection
<br>NSAID use
<br>lifestyle: smoking, alcohol
<br>cystic fibrosis, hyperparathyroidism, Zollinger Ellison
<br>rare: viral infections chemo, cronhs, gastric/lung cancers, vascular insufficiencies
<br><br>
<br>family history
<br>liver, kidney or lung disease
<br>Blood type O
<br>rheumatoid arthritis
<br><br>
<br>abdominal pain: burning sensation, gnawing = after meals or at night (due to acid irritating the ulcer)
<br>weight loss, nausea, vomiting, feeling bloated, and early satiety
<br><br>
<br>perforation - biggest concern as it can cause bleeding and infection
<br>bleeding late signs: hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, SOB, bloody emesis or stool, anemia
<br>fever from infection

<br>can be an acute or chronic
<br>multiple causes
<br><br>
<br>Diet: over consumption of alcohol; eating spicy, fried, or acidic foods

<br>stomach muscles don't work properly coz your nerves are fucked up
<br>aka, gastropathy; "paralysis of stomach muscles"
<br>affects movement of the muscles of the stomach caused by neurological dysfunction
<br>chronic disorder that results in the delay or even absence of gastric emptying
<br>food can harden in stomach because of lack of stomach movement
<br><br>
<br>damage to the vagus nerve
<br>usually complication of other diseases that affect the nerves
<br>Diabetes: #1 cause (chronic high blood sugar levels can damage the vagus nerve)
<br>other examples: surgery complications, autoimmune diseases, MS, hypothyroidism, stroke, myasthenia gravis, Parkinson's
<br>side effects of meds: opioids, CCBs, marijuana, tricyclic antidepressants
<br><br>
<br>long term use of opioids and antidepressants
<br>cytomegalovirus, eppestein-barr, varicella, chagas
<br>anorexia, bulimia
<br><br>
<br>early satiety, bloating
<br>nausea, vomiting
<br>abdominal pain
<br>acid reflux, decrease in level of energy, lack of appetite, or weight loss.
<br><br>
<br>Gastric emptying test (Scintigraphy) = gold standard, xray with dyes; to trace how fast food is moved from stomach
<br>EGD - esophagogastroduodenoscopy - tube with camera; most common =&gt;sedated procedure
<br>gastric emptying breath test (GEBT) - noninvasive, no radiation
<br><br>
<br>antidopaminergic agents: Reglan, Motilium, stimulate muscles of GI tract
<br>abx - promotes gastric emptying
<br>antiemetics - zofran/odanzetron
<br><br>
<br>diabetes patients: can go into DKA or HHS
<br>palpate abdomen for distention
<br>encourage more fluids (higher risk of dehydration)
<br>encourage lifestyle mods

<br>upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest
<br>increased intra-abdominal pressure pushes the stomach up
<br>very common among 50+
<br>2 types: sliding and paraesophageal hernias
<br>Sliding - most common<br>
<br>occur when the upper section of the stomach occasionally slides up or protrudes into the chest area through the hiatus
<br>Paraesophageal (PEH) - more advanced; can become an emergency<br>
<br>a greater portion of the stomach, a part of the esophagus, or perhaps the intestines have migrated up into the chest cavity through the hiatus.

<br>inflammation of the pancreas (from autodigestion of pancreas = digestive enzymes eat the pancreas)
<br>stems from pancreatic duct obstruction (see causes)
<br>acute or chronic

<br>Pancreas: produces enzymes to digest food (note carbs, fats, proteins); releases insulin and glucagon to regular blood sugar<br>Acute Pancreatitis - sudden, releases trypsin that causes pancreatic acinar cell death = inflammatory response, usually managed with conservative treatments<br>
Chronic Pancreatitis - ongoing, progressive inflammation, may cause irreversible organ damage from fibrosis and scarring<br><img alt="Bile Duct Locations" src="https://www.cancer.org/adobe/dynamicmedia/deliver/dm-aid--8a3486d0-70ce-42f1-b0cc-b75671658165/bile-duct-locations.jpg?quality=82&amp;preferwebp=true" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br>
<br>gall stones and alcohol abuse = most common cause

<br>Post-ERCP
<br>abdominal surgery
<br>trauma
<br>infection
<br><br>
<br>alcohol abuse
<br>smoking
<br>high-fat diet which leads to gallstone formation
<br>family hx, obesity, DM, cystic fibrosis
<br>old
<br><br>
<br>intense pain in epigastric area or left upper abd (radiates to back, worsens after eating)
<br>abdominal tenderness with guarding
<br>Hypotension - third spacing (fluid shift to interstitial space), SIRS, E- imbalance, sepsis
<br>Cullen's Sign - blue grey discoloration sign around belly button (Edward Cullen is blue-grey)
<br>Grey-Turner's Sign - ecchymosis on the patient's flank (you turn to the side to see it)
<br>Fox's Sign - ecchymosis on groin (fox = fuck area / groin)
<br>Infection: fever, chills, tachy, diaphoresis, tachypnea

<br>Dark Urine - tell-tale sign of elevated bilirubin levels
<br>clay-colored stools
<br>also: oily stool (steatorrhea)
<br>pruritus (from bile salt accumulation)
<br>Tetany - involuntary muscle contractions, typically caused by low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia)

<br>involuntary loss of urine
<br>Types:<br>
<br>Stress - caused by weakness of the urethral sphincter or the pelvic floor muscles, involuntarily urine leakage with sneezing, coughing, or physical exertion.
<br>Urge - detrusor muscle overactivity that causes bladder contraction, or; loss of neurologic control or by irritation of the bladder.
<br>Overflow - urine leakage of an overdistended bladder, which is caused by a bladder obstruction that blocks urine excretion or impaired contractility of the detrusor muscle.&nbsp;Bladder obstruction causes of the distended bladder include pelvic organ prolapse, abdominal or pelvic masses, or <a data-href="BPH" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/GU/Urinary Conditions/BPH.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">BPH</a>.

<br>Mixed - combination of urge and stress
<br><br>
<br>usually temporary; usually d/t food irritants: alcohol, spicy, sugary, caffeine, carbonated.
<br>Meds: diuretics, BP meds, Doxazosin (cardura), antidepressantsm CCB, ACEi
<br><br>
<br>coughing - stress incontinence

 <br>A medical procedure that replaces the function of the kidneys when they are no longer able to filter waste, toxins, and excess fluids from the blood.<br>Function of Dialysis:<br>
<br>remove excess fluid + electrolytes
<br>acid-base balance
<br>remove waste products
<br>restore homeostasis thru osmosis, diffusion, ultra-filtration
<br>Types of Dialysis:<br>
Hemodialysis: Blood is filtered through a machine outside the body to remove waste and excess fluids.<br>
Peritoneal Dialysis: Uses the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) to filter blood inside the body by infusing a dialysis solution into the abdomen.<br>Dialysis Access Sites<br>
Hemodialysis: Fistulas, grafts, or central venous catheters (CVC)<br>
Peritoneal Dialysis: Catheter inserted into the abdominal cavity<br>Dialysis Procedure<br>
Hemodialysis: Blood is removed, cleaned, and returned to the body via a machine over a 3-5 hour period, typically 3 times a week.<br>
Peritoneal Dialysis: Dialysate fluid is infused into the abdomen, where it absorbs waste and excess fluid, and is then drained out, typically performed daily.<br>Considerations for Fistula<br>
<br>assess patency: presence of bruit, palpable thrill, distal pulses, circulation
<br>Avoid the fistula sight! do not: measure BP, inject, venipuncture. 
<br>Elevate site after fistula creation
<br>Have protamine sulfate ready to reverse heparin. 
<br><br>

<br>DDS: Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome<br>
<br>patients new to dialysis can develop d/t rapid removal of solutes and changes in blood ph
<br>look for: BUN above 175
<br>manifestations: headaches, N/V, decreased LOC, seizures, restlessness
<br>severe: confusion, seizures, coma, death
<br><br>
<br>Priority: monitor for K! (RBCs are not affected by Dialysis)
<br>monitor kidney function values: BUN, creatinine
<br>Assess for signs of complications (e.g., infection, fluid overload)
<br>Provide education on dietary restrictions, fluid intake, and medication adherence
<br>Encourage psychological support due to the chronic nature of dialysis treatment
<br><br>
<br>Risk for Infection related to dialysis access site (e.g., fistula, catheter) and immune suppression.
<br>Imbalanced Nutrition: Less than Body Requirements related to dietary restrictions and altered metabolism due to kidney dysfunction.
<br>Fluid Volume Excess related to impaired renal function and fluid retention.
<br>Fatigue related to dialysis procedure and chronic kidney disease.
<br>Risk for Electrolyte Imbalance related to dialysis treatment, particularly changes in potassium, calcium, and sodium levels.
<br><br>
<br>Fluid restriction
<br>Limit Na
<br>Limit K (bananas, beans, potatoes, oranges, tomatoes, spinach, avocados)
<br>High protein to prevent muscle loss (dialysis removes protein in blood but for <a data-href="CKD" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/GU/CKD.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CKD</a> patients that are not undergoing dialysis, limiting protein may be indicate to prevent Uremia)

<br>Iron Supplements: oral, IV for severe cases

<br>Iron Oral Supplements =&gt; must take on EMPTY stomach to increase absorption
<br>do not take with calcium supplements
<br>Vitamin C increases iron absorption


<br>Erythropoietin: epoetin alfa - ematopoietic growth factor used to increase production of RBCs

<br>monitor for increased BP, monitor CBC, monitor for cardiac event


<br>B12 supplements - to convert folic acid

<br>administer parenterally if lack of intrinsic factors/stomach malabsorption


<br>Folic Acid Supplements
<br>Blood Transfusions - for severe only due to risk of infections
<br><br>
<br>Prevention:
<br>pregnant/menstruating = ensure more iron foods, iron supplements
<br>iron-deficient and have elevated cholesterol levels =&gt; eat more iron-rich foods that are not red or organ meats into their diets
<br>eat more folate (spinach, lentils, bananas) and folic acid fortified grains and juices
<br>Iron supplements causes constipation = increase FIBER intake
<br>CALCIUM (milk) disrupts iron absorption
<br><br>
<br>CBC <a href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn?query=tag:cbc" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span class="" style="display: none;"></span>#cbc</a>

 <br><br>
<br>type of blood clot that forms in large veins of extremities or pelvis
<br>usually occurs in lower extremities
<br>3rd most common cause of death among cardiovascular disorders
<br>DVT will go unnoticed but can dislodge and result in a pulmonary embolus, a life-threatening event
<br>Types:

<br>provoked: from an acquired cause (obesity, cancer, immobility)
<br>unprovoked: from an endogenous cause such as recurrence
<br>Proximal: above the knee, and this type is more likely to cause complications leading to PE
<br>Distal: below the knee (most common)


<br><br>
<br>pain, redness, swelling, warmth at affected extremity**
<br>edema
<br><br>
<br>no longer recommended: DVT filters on inferior vena cava
<br>Prophylaxis: SCD, Xa inhibitors (Eliquis, newer class)
<br><br>
<br>ambulate early
<br>anticoags
<br>administer Lovenox - low molecular weight heparin injection
<br>conduct "wells criteria test" - establish DVT risk
<br><br>
<br>venous doppler - detects bloow flow
<br>venography - invasive procedure involving contrast dye and xray
<br>d-dimer
<br>MRI
<br><br>
<br>caused by damage to the wall of a blood vessel
<br>turbulence to blood flow, such as with atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia
<br>hypercoagulability, meaning the blood is increasingly coagulating or clotting
<br>decreased blood flow due to immobility, surgery, catheter
<br>dehydration due to increased blood viscosity
<br>genetics - factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation
<br>CHF, COPD
<br>hospital stay
<br><br>
<br>immobility: bedrest, airplane right, anesthesia
<br>hormonal: pregnant, contraceptive therapy or hormone replacement therapy with estrogen
<br>smoking
<br>family hx, previous hx
<br>old age
<br>tumors
<br>sepsis
<br>chronic health conditions: HTN, DM
<br>Usual comorbidities: cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, eczema, vasculitis, cancer, CHF, IBS
<br>obesity: pressure on the lower extremities
<br>SSC
<br><br>
<br>DVT can dislodge and travel = becomes a PE
<br><br>
<br>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) - profoundly serious health condition

<br>clotting and anticlotting mechanisms occur at the same time.

What is it<br>
<br>Blood clots are made up of platelets and fibrin and are a gel-like consistency
<br>thrombus - when blocks vein or artery

<br>arterial thrombosis - occurs in artery
<br>venous


<br>Embolus/embolism - if it moves throughout the body; can cause serious harm
<br>Subtypes<br>
<br>Pulmonary Embolism
<br>Myocardial Infarction (MI)
<br>Ischemic Stroke - occurs in artery to the brain caused by plaque (fatty deposits)
<br>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
<br>Clinical Presentation<br>
<br>
chest pain that worsens with deep breathing

<br>
tachycardia, SOB, lightheadedness, hemoptysis

<br>
MI: chest pain radiating left arm, SOB, diaphoresis

<br>
Stroke: facial weakness, difficulty speaking, visual deficit, L/R sided weakness, seizures
Treatment

<br>
Thrombolytics - class of meds that dissolve clots

<br>Tissue Plasminogen Activator - give within 3 hours for stroke, do not use with hemorrhagic stroke, verify with CT


<br>
Thrombectomy - specialized instruments to surgically remove a blood clot

<br>
Prevention:

<br>Coumadin/Warfarin - avoid diet changes, monitor INR, high K diet contradicts this medication
<br>Factor Xa Inhibitors - Eliquis, monitoring not required, oral
<br>Lovenox/Enoxaparin
<br>Heparin - Hold heparin if the platelet count is less than 100,000/mm, monitor aPTT
<br>Plavix/Clopidogrel
<br>Antiplatelets - ensures platelets do not stick together

<br>most common: aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), usually prescribed with ACS



Nursing Interventions

<br>
ambulate

<br>
diet

<br>
note aging adults challenges

<br>
be on alert with anticoagulants <a href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn?query=tag:anticoagulant" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span class="" style="display: none;"></span>#anticoagulant</a>

<br>higher risk for bleeding
<br>Warfarin - needs INR, diet restrictions


<br>Causes/Risk Factors<br>
<br>injury or damage to vein
<br>surgery exacerbated by bed rest
<br>hormonal: oral contraceptives, pregnancy, hormone replacement, estrogen (menopause, prostate cancer)
<br>child birth after first 3 months
<br>smoking
<br>cancers: lungs, brain, pancreas, uterus, ovaries, blood cancers, chemotherapy
<br>family history
<br>Atrial Fibrillation
<br>Infection
<br>mechanical heart valves
<br>SSC - systemic sclerosis, aka "scleroderma": also provides increased risk for clots
<br>Diagnosis<br>
<br>D-dimer test: blood test, high = clot. can also be present during pregnancy or postop

<br>small fragment of protein is detected from blood clot
<br>not definitive, more testing needed if positive


<br>CT, US, MRA (magnetic resonance angiography)

<br>MRA = more specific to blood vessels


<br>V/Q scan - ventilation/perfusion test aided by radioactive and imaging techniques
<br>Systemic Effects<br>
<br>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) - profoundly serious health condition

<br>clotting and anticlotting mechanisms occur at the same time


<br><br>What is it<br>
<br>Hemorrhage: Loss of blood from damaged vessels, inside or outside the body.
<br>Severity impacts treatment and prognosis.
<br>Blood loss classess:

<br>Class I - 0-15%
<br>Class II - 15-30% (shock symptoms apparent)
<br>Class III - 30-40% (delayed cap refill, SBP&lt;90, tachy)
<br>Class IV - 40% or more, no UOP, peripheral pulses absent, shock


<br>Types of Hemorrhages:<br>
<br>Intracranial - brain bleeds
<br>Pulmonary - hemothorax; caused by trauma, cancer, or clotting
<br>Stroke - hemorrhagic; vessels rupture and blood leaks into brain
<br>Clinical Presentation<br>
<br>Symptoms vary: nausea, dizziness, cool skin, shortness of breath, weakness, tachycardia, confusion.
<br>Internal bleeding signs: hemoptysis, hematemesis, clammy skin, abdominal rigidity, altered consciousness.
<br>intracranial hemorrhage: <a href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn?query=tag:stroke" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span class="" style="display: none;"></span>#stroke</a>

<br>headaches, slurred speech or difficulty speaking, facial numbness, upper and lower extremity weakness or numbness, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, or difficulty with ambulating


<br>Treatment<br>
<br>IV fluids, blood transfusion, oxygen therapy, warming blankets, emotional support.
<br>Type and cross-match for blood products.
<br>Physical and occupational therapy for rehabilitation.
<br>Nursing Interventions<br>
<br>Goal: stop the bleed
<br>Assess and identify bleeding source, apply pressure, ensure IV access, administer fluids.
<br>Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and mental status.
<br>Educate on gradual activity increase and rest.
<br>MAP &gt; 65 mm Hg indicates adequate cardiac perfusion.<br>
MAP = (DBP×2) + SBP /3<br>Diagnostic Tools<br>
<br>CBC, platelet count, PT, PTT.
<br>CT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds
<br>endoscopy for suspected GI bleeds.
<br>Causes<br>
<br>Traumatic injuries, cancer, clotting disorders, elevated BP leading to ruptured aneurysm.
<br>Risk Factors<br>
<br>Trauma, accidents, cancer
<br>blood clotting disorders: hemophillia (genetic mutation)
<br>poor people = higher risk
<br>postpartum hemorrhage = atony (flaccid fetus due to significant blood loss during childbirth or postpartum period)
<br>Systemic Effects<br>
<br>Hypovolemic shock: decreased cardiac output, circulatory insufficiency, hypoxemia.
<br>Cognitive impairments, fatigue, depression, anxiety, PTSD.
<br>Orthostatic hypotension increases fall risk.

<br>cause tissues in the body to become hypoxic, leading to many complications
<br>sickle-shaped RBCs flowing through the blood vessels of the client’s abdomen, chest, and joints cause severe pain, which can last for hours or days
<br>Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (VOC) - a painful complication of sickle cell anemia that occurs when blood vessels are blocked by sickle-shaped red blood cells<br>
Symptoms: severe pain, acute chest syndrome (reduced lung perfusion = DEADLY), dactilytis (inflammation of finger, toes), priapism<br><br>
<br>both parents must be carriers of the sickle cell trait for the child to be affected

<br>if only one parent is carrier, child will be carrier only


<br><br>
<br>genetics
<br><br>
<br>severe pain - affects ADLs, damage to joints

<br>can cause anxiety, depression, stress, sleep disorder, poor coping


<br>fatigue caused by anemia (sickle cells die within 10-20 days, normal life span is 120 days)
<br>swelling of hands and feet
<br>visual deficits (sickle cells block vessels in eyes)
<br>anemia symptoms
<br>Acute Chest Syndrome - emergency
<br><br>
<br>stroke
<br>blindness
<br>blood clots during pregnancy and hypertension
<br>acute chest syndrome - most serious

<br>blood flow can be blocked to the lungs, causing breathing difficulty, fever, and severe chest pain
<br>emergency!


<br>Damage to organs, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcerations due to poor circulation, blindness, priapism, DVT, and gallstones are all diseases or disorders that can occur in clients who have sickle cell anemia.
<br><br>
<br>newborn screening - serum test
<br>Hemoglobin electrophoresis to identify the type of hemoglobin.
<br>Complete blood count (CBC) showing anemia and high reticulocyte count.
<br>Peripheral blood smear showing sickled cells.
<br><br>
<br>pain management
<br>IV fluids for hydration
<br>blood transfusion
<br>Hydroxyurea - reactivates production of fetal hemoglobin
<br>prevention:

<br>drink 8 glasses water daily to prevent dehydration (dehydration = crisis)
<br>avoid extreme temp changes
<br>avoid high altitudes affecting O2 intake


<br><br>
<br>lookout for iron overload arising from frequent blood transfusions

<br>iron deposits in organs = organ damage
<br>needs iron chelation therapy


<br>encourage support group
<br><br>
<br>Drink 3-4L per day
<br>Avoid traveling to high altitudes and airplanes =&gt; reduced oxygen, can lead to vaso-occlusive crisis
<br>Avoid activities that require persistent exposure to cold weather

 <br>
<br>A type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals
<br>Uric acid crystals form and deposit in the joints, causing inflammation and pain
<br>Often affects the big toe (podagra), but can involve other joints such as the knees, wrists, and elbows.
<br>Acute episodes of gout may last a few days to weeks and can be triggered by dietary factors, alcohol, dehydration, or trauma.
<br><br>
<br>Hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood) due to: excessive production OR reduced excretion
<br>Genetic predisposition (family history of gout)
<br>High purine foods (red meats, shellfish, organ meats)
<br>Alcohol consumption (beer and liquor)
<br>Sugary drinks (high fructose corn syrup)
<br>Excessive intake of processed foods
<br>Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease increase risk.
<br>Medications (e.g., diuretics, low-dose aspirin) can elevate uric acid levels.
<br><br>
<br>Male gender (more common in men, especially age 30-50)
<br>Obesity (increased uric acid production)
<br>Chronic kidney disease (decreased excretion of uric acid)
<br>Family history of gout
<br>Medications (diuretics, immunosuppressive drugs)
<br>Hypertension and metabolic syndrome
<br><br>
<br>Severe, sudden pain in a joint, most commonly the big toe (podagra)
<br>Swelling, redness, warmth in the affected joint
<br>Pain may be excruciating to touch, with symptoms often occurring at night
<br>Tophi (hard nodules) may form in chronic gout, typically around the joints or ears
<br>Fever in severe cases
<br>Long-term: Tophi formation in joints, tendons, or skin, joint deformities
<br><br>
<br>Joint damage and deformities due to long-term uric acid crystal deposition
<br>Kidney stones (due to uric acid buildup in kidneys)
<br>Chronic pain and decreased mobility
<br>Cardiovascular issues (increased risk of hypertension and heart disease)
<br>Tophi formation in soft tissues
<br><br>
<br>Joint aspiration (synovial fluid analysis): Identifies uric acid crystals under a microscope.
<br>Blood tests: Elevated serum uric acid levels (although may not be elevated during acute attack).
<br>X-rays: May show joint damage in chronic gout cases or presence of tophi.
<br>Ultrasound: Detects urate crystals in joints and soft tissues.
<br><br>Acute attack management:<br>
<br>NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) to reduce pain and inflammation
<br>Colchicine (reduces inflammation and pain, especially within the first 24 hours)
<br>Corticosteroids (oral or injected into the joint) for severe cases
<br>Uric acid-lowering drugs:<br>
<br>Allopurinol (reduces uric acid production)
<br>Febuxostat (alternative to allopurinol)
<br>Probenecid (increases uric acid excretion by kidneys)
<br>Lifestyle modifications:<br>
<br>Low-purine diet: Avoid red meats, shellfish, and organ meats
<br>Limit alcohol (especially beer and liquor)
<br>Weight loss (reduces uric acid levels)
<br>Adequate hydration (helps prevent uric acid crystals from forming)
<br><br>
<br>Pain management: Administer NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids as prescribed.
<br>Encourage proper hydration: Fluids help in reducing uric acid concentration in the blood.
<br>Monitor serum uric acid levels during treatment.
<br>Education on lifestyle changes
<br>Prevent future attacks: Ensure patient adheres to long-term medications (e.g., allopurinol) and dietary modifications.
<br>Monitor for signs of kidney stones (severe pain, hematuria).
<br><br>
<br>Acute pain related to inflammation from uric acid crystals
<br>Impaired physical mobility related to joint pain and swelling
<br>Ineffective health maintenance related to poor dietary habits or medication adherence
<br>Risk for injury related to decreased mobility from joint inflammation

 <br><br>Macular degeneration, often called age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is the central loss of vision that affects the macula of the eye.<br>
<br>There is no cure for macular degeneration.
<br>AMD is a common cause of vision loss in older adults.&nbsp;G
<br><br>Dry macular degeneration is the most common and is caused by a gradual blockage in retinal capillary arteries, which results in the macula becoming ischemic and necrotic due to the lack of retinal cells.<br>Wet macular degeneration is a less common form and is caused by the new growth of blood vessels that have thin walls that leak blood and fluid.<br><br>A cataract is an opacity in the lens of an eye that impairs vision.<br>Postoperative care should focus on the following.<br>
<br>Preventing an increase in intraocular pressure (straining, bending over the waist, sneezing, blowing nose, coughing, etc)
<br>Preventing infection.
<br>Administering ophthalmic medications.

<br>Medications:<br>
<br>Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) – reduces cerebral edema =&gt; initial target of serum osmolality is often set at 300–320 mOsmol/kg. 
<br>Hypertonic saline (3%) – pulls fluid out of brain cells
<br>Corticosteroids (dexamethasone) – for tumors, inflammation
<br>Sedatives (propofol, benzodiazepines) – decrease metabolic demand
<br>Antiepileptics – prevent seizures: benzo, phenytoin, valproic acid
<br>Neuromuscular blockers (for severe cases requiring intubation)

<br>Assess pupil reaction (PERRLA) and vital signs frequently
<br>Maintain head and neck alignment (avoid flexion or turning head)
<br>Minimize stimulation (low lights, quiet room)
<br>Avoid straining (stool softeners, prevent coughing/sneezing)
<br>Cluster nursing care to minimize ICP spikes
<br>Seizure precautions (padded rails, oxygen, suction at bedside)

<br>Spinal Cord roles:<br>
<br>send stimuli from body to brain
<br>send motor instructions from brain to body
<br>direct reflexes
<br>Spinal Cord Reflexes - do not rely on brain to transmit reflex<br>Vertebrae Count- In Order: Breakfast at 7, Lunch at 12, Dinner at 5<br>
<br>Cervical - 7 (but has 8 cervical nerve roots)
<br>Thoracic - 12
<br>Lumbar - 5
<br>Sacral - 5
<br>Coccyx - 1
<br><br>Classification based on Mechanism of Injury:<br>
<br>Compression of Spinal Cord - most common, caused by vertebral fractures with bone fragments or dislocation
<br>Intermittent Compression - often seen in hyperextension injuries
<br>Distraction Injury -  two adjoining vertebrae have been pulled apart, causing the spine to stretch and tear. 
<br>Transection and Laceration - a projectile object or bone fragments from significant dislocations can tear or sever the spinal cord. 
<br>Classification based on Location =&gt; see vertebrae count<br>Classification based on Severity =&gt; loss of all sensation and control below the damage (complete, vs incomplete)<br>
<br>A - complete SCI, no sensory function, no motor function
<br>B - some sensory function, no motor function
<br>C - some sensory function, some motor function (less than half can lift against gravity)
<br>D - same as C, but more than half have motor
<br>Secondary Injury - result after the initial injury d/t impaired blood flow (e.g. inflammation, hematoma formation, blood loss, and hypovolemic shock)<br><br>
<br>Impaired Mobility
<br>Sexual Dysfunction - depends on level of injury
<br>Mental health: dealing with changes and limitations, body image, suicide risk

 <br><br>
<br>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome =&gt; occurs after 7 days of a triggering event
<br>results in pulmonary artery vasoconstriction =&gt; pulmonary hypertension
<br>life threatening and requires ventilation!
<br>Key Differences Between regular pneumonia:<br>
ARDS:<br>
<br>can be infections or non infectious (PNA is caused by infection)
<br>rapid onset
<br>widespread alveolar damage (PNA is localized)
<br>treated with supportive care only (PNA is antibiotics + supportive)
<br>higher mortality of 30-40% 
<br><br>
<br>Injury Trigger: Direct (e.g. pneumonia, aspiration) or indirect (e.g. sepsis, trauma) lung injury causes inflammation    
<br>Alveolar-Capillary Damage: Inflammatory mediators damage alveolar-capillary membrane → increased permeability    
<br>Fluid Leak: Protein-rich fluid leaks into alveoli → pulmonary edema  
<br>Impaired Gas Exchange: Edema + collapsed alveoli (atelectasis) → ↓ surfactant, ↓ compliance, severe hypoxemia    
<br>Ventilation-Perfusion Mismatch: Poor oxygenation despite oxygen therapy (refractory hypoxemia)    
<br>Progression: Can lead to fibrotic lung changes and multi-organ failure if not reversed
<br>BERLIN DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (all 4 must be met):<br>
<br>Timing - Within 1 week of clinical insult or new/worsening respiratory symptoms
<br>Chest Imaging - Bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules
<br>Origin of Edema:

<br>Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload
<br>Objective assessment (e.g., echo) needed if no clear risk factor


<br>Oxygenation (on PEEP ≥5 cm H₂O)
<br>Mild ARDS: PaO₂/FiO₂ 200–300 mmHg<br>
Moderate ARDS: PaO₂/FiO₂ 100–200 mmHg<br>
Severe ARDS: PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤100 mmHg<br><br>
<br>Sepsis =&gt; MOST COMMON CAUSE
<br>Pneumonia - also common
<br>Aspiration - also common
<br>Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)
<br><br>
<br>female
<br>60+
<br>trauma

<br>dyspnea =&gt; progressively worsens within 6 to 72 hours after the event
<br>respiratory distress
<br>tachypnea
<br>diffuse crackles
<br>tachycardia
<br>Severe cases: somnolent, cyanosis, diaphoresis
<br>NOTE SIGNATURE MANIFESTATION: DOES NOT RESPOND TO OXYGENATION!
<br>Somnolent - reduced level of consciousness that is described as lethargic or drowsy<br><br><br>
<br>muscle wasting - due to inactivity, patients are too SOB to do anything
<br>weight loss
<br>Functional Impairment - due to decreased mobility, atrophy, weakness
<br>Cognitive loss - caused by brain hypoxia
<br>Dependency on: g-tube for nutrition, new tracheostomy
<br>Prolonged symptoms: exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance
<br>greater impact for geriatric
<br><br>Berlin Criteria for ARDS: <br>
<br>onset occurring within 7 days of an event
<br>non-cardiac origin
<br>imaging indicating bilateral lung infiltrates
<br>specific abnormal oxygenation measurements (PaO/FiO ratio of less than 300 mm Hg to confirm the diagnosis)
<br>Other Diagnostic Tools: <br>
<br>ABG
<br>PaO2/Fio2 - less than 300 mm Hg (normal range is over 400 =&gt; note that this is a ratio!)
<br>FiO2 &amp; PaO2 =&gt; determines severity of ARDS (mild, moderate, severe)
<br>Impaired Kidney Function - elevated, <a data-href="CMP" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Foundations/Labs/CMP.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CMP</a>
<br>Cardiac Enzymes - rule out cardiac origin
<br><br>Goals:<br>
<br>increase O2 delivery
<br>avoid injury to lungs
<br>decrease shunting
<br>decrease O2 consumption
<br>Strategies: <br>
<br>Lung Protective Ventilation (avoid ventilator induced trauma, not too in-depth in exam)
<br>judicious suctioning only PRN
<br>Pain Management &amp; Sedation
<br>V/Q match
<br>Avoid infection/VAPs: HOB 30, oral care, hand hygiene
<br>Turning: passive ROMs, avoiding DVT/PE (thru SCDs, anticoagulants)
<br>Ventilator Weaning ias tolerated
<br>Treatment Interventions: <br>
<br>Pre-intubation: high-flow O2 NC or FM
<br>Intubation meds: Sedative (etomidate), neuromuscular Blockers (succinylcholine)
<br>note: sedate before you paralyze, BVM at bedside (1 breath q.1sec)
<br>Very tube placement: CXR
<br>Verify collar pressure: between 20 and 30 cm of water
<br>Positioning: prone to relieve pressure in lungs
<br>Diuretic
<br>Nutrition: OG, NGT, PEG
<br>Peptic Ulcer Disease prophylaxis =&gt; prevent GI bleeds or stress ulcers (usually thru PPI, see <a data-href="PPI and H2 Blockers" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Pharmacology/GI Meds/PPI and H2 Blockers.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PPI and H2 Blockers</a>)
<br>DVT Prophylaxis
<br><br>
<br>Trend Labs: monitor for impending sepsis or renal failure
<br>Skin Integrity
<br>Monitor for Oxygen Toxicity, Pulmonary Edema (early on), Left Ventricular dysfunction
<br><a data-href="MODS" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/Immunity &amp; Inflammation/MODS.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">MODS</a> is a huge possibility
<br>Delirium - sign of hypoxia, difficulty in administering treatments
<br><br>
<br>max intubation is 14 days
<br>Intubated patient: vitals signs q5min
<br>Sedation scales - do not go too in-depth but familiarize yourself
<br><br>
<br>Assess, prevent, and manage pain
<br>Both spontaneous awakening trials (SAT) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) = &gt; wean off vent, reduce o2 support, sedation vacation
<br>Choice of analgesia and sedation
<br>Delirium:&nbsp;assess, prevent, and manage
<br>Early mobility and exercise
<br>Family engagement and empowerment
<br>Focused Assessments: ABC:<br>
<br>A - attend, intubated =&gt; tube placement, line tracing, vent settings, patient response (ABGs reassuring), b/l lung sounds, infection (oral care), capnography
<br>B - dyspnea, tachypnea, low SPO2, crackles, rales, 
<br>C - tachycardia, cyanosis, hypotensive,

Long-Acting Anti-Cholinergic Agents (e.g., ipratropium/albuterol, tiotropium): Relieve symptoms, reduce inflammation.<br>
Adverse reactions: urinary retention, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, respiratory issues.<br>Systemic Effects<br>
<br>perfusion - can lead to hypoxemia
<br>neurological - damaged brain cells d/t hypoxemia, leads to death

<br>memory loss, poor judgement, inattentiveness, decreased muscle coordination


<br>Renal - hypoxemia leads to decreased renal tissue perfusion =&gt; fluid, electrolyte imbalance
<br>Mobility - impaired QOL, worse health outcomes
<br>Risk Factors:<br>
<br>genetics
<br>tobacco exposure
<br>environmental particulates, allergens, infections, pollution
<br>chemicals, perfume, candles, changing weather
<br>allergic sensitization - repeated exposure to allergen increases risk
<br>obesity
<br>more common in males prior to puberty, but opposite after
<br>Phenotypes or Subcategories of Asthma:<br>
<br>Allergic Asthma

<br>most common
<br>begins in childhood 
<br>usually accompanied by family hx of allergic disorders/exczema


<br>Nonallergic Asthma

<br>less common
<br>common in adults, rare in children
<br>poor response to treatment other than corticosteroids


<br>Aspirin-sensitive Asthma

<br>flare-up when taking aspirin or NSAIDs
<br>accompanied by chronic rhinitis or nasal inflammation


<br>Exercise-Induced Asthma

<br>if client exercises to a certain capacity, they will flare up
<br>managed by pre and post meds


<br>Comorbidities:<br>
<br>obesity can exacerbate SOB
<br>rhinitis
<br>vocal cord dysfunction (voice box does not open correctly)
<br>GERD
<br>OSA
<br><br>
<br>rapid onset asthma attack
<br>severe asthma
<br>Emergency! Very life-threatening
<br>potential acute ventilatory failure or death (d/t hypoxia or hypercapnia)
<br>requires ventiation
<br>10% mortality rate in ICU
<br>Important: give bronchodilator first before oxygen<br>Risk Factors:<br>
<br>poor recognition of dyspnea
<br>usually have other comorbidities
<br>previous episode of S.A., prior intubation
<br>CAD as a result of adverse reactions from meds
<br>Impact:<br>
<br>airways close prematurely when the client exhales leading to an increase in the volume that remains in the lung (functional residual capacity) and air trapping
<br>leads to hypoxemia that then causes lactic acidosis
<br>stress of having asthma coupled with comorbidities that are associated with it can lead to increases in asthmatic episodes
<br>respiratory system of the aging adult undergoes physiological changes and can mimic the presence of airway obstruction
<br>Signs/Symptoms:<br>
<br>SOB, unable to speak full sentences
<br>chest tightness
<br>accessory muscle use
<br>late signs: drowsiness, confusion, cyanosis
<br>sx do not develop at the same time
<br>mucus plug can lead to asphyxia
<br>resp acidosis
<br>wheezing may not be present on auscultation

<br>absent wheezes = indicate retained secretions and deteriorating respiratory function


<br>Alkalosis if hyperventilating
<br>Diagnostic:<br>
<br>breath sounds
<br>SPO2
<br>ABG
<br>BP - monitor for pulsus paradoxus (When blood pressure drops by more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration.)
<br>LOC &amp; fatigue
<br>PEFR - peak expiratory flow rate; if less than 50% of best = status asthmaticus
<br>PEV
<br>CBC - check for WBC elevation
<br>Systemic Effects:<br>
<br>Perfusion - decreased left ventricular filling and outflow (look for pulsus paradoxus)
<br>MSK - rhabdo from excessive accessory muscle use, hypercapnia, steroids, neuromuscular blocking agents
<br>Treatment:<br>
<br>SABA - relief from bronchospasm
<br>oral or IV corticosteroids - decrease inflammation of airway
<br>O2 for cyanosis, dyspnea
<br>IV fluids for hydration
<br>Magnesium sulfate for smooth muscle relaxation
<br>critical care until symptoms resolve or after 24 hours, then focus on education re: meds and irritants

<br>Bronchoscopy - endoscopic technique of visualizing the inside of the airways for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes

<br>consent for needed: involve sedation
<br>remove dentures, glasses
<br>tissue sample may be obtained
<br>positioning: patient will be hyperextended to allow alignment of trachea and pharynx to easily insert scope


<br>Transillumination - allows passage of light through body tissues

<br>occluded sinuses prevent passage of light rays  thru sinus air sacs
<br>clear sinus = allow light

 <br>2 Types:<br>
<br>WET SUCTION - CLOSED SYSTEM
<br>DRY SUCTION - connected to wall suction
<br><br>
<br>Drainage Collection Chamber =&gt; connected to patient, monitor every 15min first 2 hours (normal: serous, clear, red, ABNORMAL: purulent or yellow, bright red blood (abnormal)
<br>Water Seal Chamber =&gt; allows removal of volume from pleural space without allowing air in, sterile water only, add if needed (normal: tidaling =&gt; rise and fall during ventilation, continuous bubbling: air leak, no bubbling: kink or occluded, lung re-expanded (need re-eval)
<br>Suction Control Chamber =&gt; can be wet or dry.
<br><br>Dry = Dial on the system (mechanical suction control)<br>
<br>Two or three chambers: drainage, water seal, mechanical suction control (no water)    
<br>Suction set with dial or regulator, often quieter
<br>Quieter, portable, easier for ambulation

<br>Easier setup in emergency or transport
<br><br>
<br>Needs sterile water for suction chamber    
<br>May be noisy due to bubbling    
<br>Water level must be checked/refilled if evaporated
<br>Suction Control Chamber =&gt;  Continuous bubbling is normal (if bubble too violent = suction too high!)<br><br>
<br>keep drainage below chest level
<br>must have two rubber-tipped hemostats in the room (in case of dislodgement)

 <br><br>
<br>persistent respiratory manifestations and airflow limitation
<br>airway restriction caused by noxious gas and/or particle exposure 
<br>can be caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema
<br>COPD is a broad term that includes bronchitis and emphysema
<br>Emphysema<br>
<br>permanent enlargement of airspaces and destruction of airspace walls
<br>affects respiratory bronchioles, alveolar sacs, ducts, alveoli
<br>Chronic Bronchitis - inflammation of bronchial tubes, leading to increased mucus production and coughing<br><br>
<br>common: cigarette smoke =&gt; more mucus production =&gt; cilliary function decreases =&gt; inflammation
<br>thickened and fibrosed alveoli =&gt; damaged macrophages =&gt; more infection
<br><br>
<br>smoking
<br>exposure to noxious gases
<br>occupational exposure to dust, fumes
<br>environmental pollutants, biomass fuel
<br>female
<br>allergen sensitivities
<br>asthma
<br>chronic lung disease
<br><br>
<br>dyspnea, chronic cough, sputum production
<br>exertional dyspnea = most common early manifestation
<br>wheezing, chest tightness
<br>barrel chest - severe and late sign
<br>late sign and poor prognosis: weight loss
<br>decreased breath sounds, crackles at lung bases
<br>sit leaning forward slightly = use of accessory muscles of neck
<br>Pursed lip expiration
<br>Hoover's sign = drawing in of the lower ribs while inhaling
<br>Neck vein distention due to intrathoracic pressure during 
<br><br>
<br>thromboembolic disease
<br>lung cancer
<br>resp failure
<br><br>
<br>increased mortality rate
<br>weight loss - too busy coughing to eat
<br>skeletal muscle dysfunction - decreased mobility, decreased nutrition, inactivity, hypoxia, inflammation
<br>more pronounced on elderly
<br><br>
<br>goal: control symptoms, not die, improve QOL
<br>SABA , LABA, inhaled corticosteroids, anticholinergics, methylxanthines, LAMA (antimuscarinic agents)

<br>methylxanthines - relax smooth muscles in airway (Theophylline)


<br>Vaccines: influenza, pneumococcal (PVC13), RSV (&gt;60yo)
<br><br>
<br>CAPTURE questionnaire (0 or 1 =&gt; no risk, 5-6 =&gt; severe)
<br>weak expiratory flow
<br>PFT especially spirometry =&gt; gold standard of diagnosing COPD

<br>spirometry before and after bronchodilator to determine airflow limitation is reversible
<br>Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1)
<br>forced Vital Capacity (FVC)


<br>SPO2
<br>CXR - to rule out dyspnea/sputum
<br>CT - determine severity of disease
<br><br>
<br>increased mortality rate from respiratory failure

 <br>What is it?<br>
<br>collection of blood in pleural space: between visceral and parietal pleura 
<br>often associated with traumatic thoracic injuries from blunt or penetrating injury 
<br>life-threatening due to hemodynamic and respiratory compromise
<br>blood limits airway functioning, increases vascular resistance = leads to cardiac arrest, death
<br>Clinical Presentation<br>
<br>similar to pneumothorax
<br>respiratory distress, tachycardia, tachypnea, decreased or absent breath sounds, dull percussion 
<br>asymmetrical chest movement, hypoxia, hypotension
<br>JVD - late sign, but maybe absent in hemothorax
<br>subcutaneous emphysema 
<br>Treatment<br>
<br>tube thoracostomy (aka "chest tube")
<br>semi-fowler
<br>analgesia and O2
<br>splinting
<br>Nursing Considerations &amp; Interventions<br>
<br>educate on seat belt, driving impairment, road safety
<br>note that SPO2 of aging adult is usually 93-94%
<br>encourage early mobility
<br>prevent anxiety
<br>Complications &amp; Other Systemic Effects<br>
<br>usually accompanied by chest wall injury, rib fx, flail chest, cardiovascular injury 
<br>hypoxia and hypecapnia
<br>Causes<br>
<br>motor vehicle collision - most common cause
<br>blunt chest trauma
<br>less common: iatrogenic, vascular, infectious diseases, spontaneous

<br>iatrogenic: anticoagulation treatment for pulmonary emboli with warfarin, thoracentesis, CVC

<br>most common: chest tube insertion




<br>all involve: major arteries: intercostal arteries and aorta
<br>Risk Factors<br>
<br>comorbidities: congenital diseases (hemophilia, thrombocytopenia)
<br>Diagnosis<br>
<br>CXR - 1st line tool
<br>ultrasound or FAST
<br>ECG
<br>ABG
<br>CBC - HGB

<br>episodes of partial or complete collapse of the airway, with decreased SPO2 <a href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn?query=tag:osa" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span class="" style="display: none;"></span>#osa</a>
<br>defined by apneic episodes caused by repetitive upper airway obstructions, then arousal causing individual to reopen airway and resume breathing
<br>leads to poor sleep, loud snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness

<br>secondary effect: memory, learning, decision making


<br>Detailed pathophysiology:<br>
<br>tongue - huge factor, most common structure associated with
<br>decreased muscle tone of nasopharynx decreases during sleep
<br>Signs and Symptoms:<br>
<br>loud snoring with breathing cessation for 10 seconds or longer, following by loud snore (arousal)
<br>may have 1-500 episodes per night
<br>incidence increases as weight increases
<br>daytime:

<br>chronic fatigue, irritability, moodiness, headache, sleepiness, decreased libido


<br>nighttime:

<br>snoring, gasping, fragmented sleep, nocturia, insomnia, night sweats


<br>Diagnostic Studies:<br>
<br>history and physical exam
<br>PSG - polysomnographic test: records brain waves/EEG, blood oxygen, HR, RR, EMG, ECG

<br>gold standard for dx of OSA
<br>airflow is also measured, with breathing patterns
<br>calculated apnea-hypoapnea index (AHI) = # of apneas per hour


<br>Treatment:<br>
<br>mandibular advancement device: prevents tongue and soft tissue from blocking airway
<br>CPAP: one pressure setting continuously, decreases work of breathing, prevents airway collapse
<br>BiPAP: different pressures on exhale/inhale, for removing CO2, more complex settings
<br>Surgical:

<br>tonsillectomy
<br>resection of pharyngeal soft tissue
<br>partial removal of soft palate and uvula
<br>nasal septoplasty
<br>maxillofacial surgeries 


<br>Medications:

<br>Modafinil (Provigil) reduces daytime sleepiness

<br>inhibits dopamine reuptake
<br>adverse: anxiety, HA, nausea


<br>Protriptyline (Triptil) - increases respiratory drive, improves airway muscle tone

<br>taken at bedtime
<br>also an antidepressant (tricyclic antidepressant)
<br>adverse: anxiety, confusion, headache
<br>taken with CPAP/BiPAP




<br>Nursing responsibilities:<br>
<br>facilitate effective sleep environment: dim lights, draw curtains, door slightly closed
<br>provide humidified O2, reposition to one side, encourage deep breathing exercises
<br>elevate head of bed
<br>encourage lifestyle changes: smoking cessation, weight
<br>Risk Factors<br>
<br>obesity
<br>larger neck circumference
<br>high fat around pharynx
<br>nasal congestion
<br>thickened pharyngeal walls
<br>facial malformations
<br>most common in overweight to obese
<br>Effects on Health (other diseases it can lead to):<br>
<br>systemic HTN, cardiac arythmia, heart failure, stroke, MI
<br>contributes to cognitive deficits: irritability, errors, accidents, moodiness, depression
<br>nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
<br>daytime drowsiness, loss of independence
<br>Aging adult considerations:<br>
<br>more contributing factors:

<br>loss of teeth, muscle dysfunction, other comorbidities (stroke, dementia, HF, edema)
<br>sleepiness may be attributed to old age vs OSA symptom

<br>CXR
<br>thoracentesis - Removal of fluid or air from around the lung.
<br>US
<br><br>
<br>Thoracentesis - can be at the bedside, w/ or w/o ultrasound guidance

<br>Bloody fluid = trauma
<br>milky fluid -  effusion has been sitting there a long time
<br>purulent - infection
<br>Fluid Analysis =&gt; determine if a transudate or exudative effusion is present.


<br>Thoracoscopy -  insertion of a thin tube with a camera into the pleural space to evaluate the pleural space and take samples of the lung tissue and lymph nodes. ​​​​​​​
<br>Treat Cause: abx for infection, if HF =&gt; diuretics, nitroglycerin, PE =&gt; anticoagluants
<br>Pleurodesis - procedure that aims to eliminate the pleural space, the area between the lungs and chest wall, by making the two layers of the pleura (the membrane lining the lungs and chest wall) stick together. This is done to prevent the accumulation of fluid or air in the pleural space,
<br>Surgical Pleurectomy or Pleuroperitoneal Shunt Insertion - small catheter attached to a drainage bottle is inserted into the effusion. The client’s treatment can be managed on an outpatient basis.

<br>a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
<br>Types:<br>
Traumatic Pneumothorax<br>
<br>blunt or penetrating trauma creates one-way valve into pleural space
<br>air goes in but does not go out
<br>common causes: rib fracture, bult trauma, flying or diving, changes in pressure
<br>subtypes:<br>
Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) - without underlying lung disease but in the presence of asymptomatic bullae or blebs that rupture<br>
Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (SSP) - lung disease is present, most commonly, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
<br>Open Pneumo - air entering through an open wound in the chest (sucking sound occurs as air rushes through the chest walls)<br>
Iatrogenic - type of traumatic; caused by a medical treatment or procedure (thoracentesis or biopsy)<br>
Tension Pneumo -  severe form, air enters the chest cavity, becomes trapped, and cannot be expelled (common causes: barotrauma, ventilation tracheostomy injury, occlusive dressing ineffective)<br><br>
<br>subpleural bleb -  a small air-filled cyst located on the surface of the lung, close to the pleural lining. They are typically asymptomatic but can rupture, leading to a pneumothorax

 <br><br>
<br>A life-threatening condition where a thrombus or emboli blocks blood flow in the pulmonary arteries, reducing oxygen exchange and straining the heart.
<br>Medical Emergency!
<br>Terms to note:<br>
Thrombus - A blood clot that forms within a blood vessel<br>
Embolus - moving clot or particle that travels through the bloodstream until it lodges in a smaller vessel; made up of fat, air, or tumor<br>Hence, a thrombus can become an emboli<br>REMEMBER:<br>
<br>Thrombus = Stays Put
<br>Embolus = Moves and Block
<br><br>
<br>DVT (most common cause)
<br>Fat embolism (from fractures)
<br>Air embolism (from IV lines or trauma)
<br>Amniotic fluid embolism (during labor)
<br>Tumor embolism (from metastatic cancer)
<br><br>Virchow’s triad - increased coagulability, venous stasis, and endothelial tissue injury<br>Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) - when patient presents with both PE and DVT<br>Risk Factors:<br>
<br>females (early and middle adult age groups)
<br>males (elderly)
<br>age: 40+
<br>Black Americans
<br>Family History/Genetics: thrombophilia, protein C or S deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia
<br>Venous Statis: Immobility or prolonged bed rest

<br>travel greater than 4 hr by air
<br>bedrest greater than three days


<br>Surgery (especially orthopedic or abdominal)
<br>Hospitalization for HF, A.Fib, A.Flutter, central venous catherization
<br>Obesity
<br>Pregnancy and postpartum period
<br>Smoking
<br>Oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (ESTROGEN BASED)
<br>Cancer - tumors may dislodge, more immobile
<br>Previous DVT or PE
<br>Fractures (especially long bones)
<br>Poor - increased air pollution exposure
<br><br>
<br>sudden onset dyspnea - most common
<br>chest pain
<br>tachypnea
<br>tachycardia
<br>hypoxia
<br>anxiety &amp; restlessness
<br>cough
<br>HEMOPTYSIS -  not a common presenting manifestation (ATI)

<br>blood or blood-tinged sputum from the mouth or trachea that originated in the lungs or the lower respiratory tract.


<br>Severe: syncope, hypotension, cyanosis, shock symptoms
<br>Less common: arrythmias (AFIB), JVD
<br><br>Low Risk - asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable<br>
Intermediate-Risk (or submassive) - right ventricular dysfunction, low BP (corrected with IVF)<br>
High-Risk - hemodynamically unstable<br><br>
<br>Pulmonary hypertension
<br>Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale)
<br>Shock
<br>Death (if untreated)
<br><br>
<br>CTPA - computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram =&gt; Gold Standard, uses contrast dye thru arteries, then x-ray. visualizes arteries, locates obstruction
<br>ABG =&gt; reveals respiratory alkalosis, hypocapnia
<br>Troponin =&gt; may be elevated in moderate to large PEs
<br>D-Dimer - elevated d/t presence of clot
<br>Chest X-Ray =&gt; may not show PE but can rule out atelectasis, effusion, or other causes for dyspnea
<br>Assessment Findings:<br>
<br>abnormal lung sounds on auscultation: rales or diminished
<br>abnormal heart sounds: gallop
<br><br>Treatment Goals:<br>
<br>Maintain Oxygenation, at least 90% SPO2
<br>Maintain Mental Status
<br>Prevent Further Emoblism
<br>Avoid Complications
<br>Interventions<br>
Supplemental O2<br>
<br>Mechanical Ventilation if unstable
<br>ECMO - extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
<br>Thrombolysis (Alteplase) - clot-busting meds 
<br>Thrombectomy - surgical removal of clot using endovascular device
<br>Anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, enoxaparin) -  does not dissolve clots but prevents new ones from forming
<br>Anticoagulation therapy for a minimum of three months
<br><br>
<br>Evaluate Risk Factors for a VTE: examine lower extremities; note swelling, warmth, tender or hard veins in calves
<br>Prevention is Easier Than Treatment! - ensure VTE prophylaxis (pharmacological or mechanical-SCDs), encourage ambulation, hydration
<br>Note bleeding risk R/T anticoagulant therapy
<br>Educate: anticoagulation medications, increased chance of recurrence, medical tag/bracelet, bleeding precautions, avoid risky activities, mobility, lifestyle, nutrition

<br>Nursing Management of the Client with Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance, Infusion Therapy, and Acid-Base Imbalance  

<br>Sodium (hypernatremia/hyponatremia)  
<br>Potassium (hyperkalemia/hypokalemia)  
<br>Calcium (hypercalcemia/hypocalcemia)  
<br>Magnesium (hypermagnesemia/hypomagnesemia)  
<br>Phosphate (Hyperphosphatemia/hypophosphatemia)  
<br>Acid base imbalance  
<br>Infusion therapy  
<br>Diagnostic tests  
<br>Treatments 


<br><br><br>What is it<br>
<br>A state where fluid output exceeds fluid intake
<br>loss of sodium and water leads to a decrease in circulating volume.
<br>Clinical Presentation<br>
<br>tachy, dry mucosa, hypotension, thirst, decreased skin turgor, flat neck veins
<br>decreased UOP, muscle cramps, lightheadedness, orthostatic hypotension
<br>when in hypovolemic shock: clammy, cold, cyanotic, confusion
<br>Lab values:

<br>Hct - increased (blood is more concentrated)
<br>Na - increased
<br>Serum Osmolality - increased
<br>BUN - increased
<br>UA-gravity: increased


<br>Treatment<br>
<br>fluid replacement; orally preferred
<br>IVF if oral

<br>Isotonic Crystalloids - NS
<br>balanced isotonic crystalloids - LR
<br>Hypotonic - 0.45% NaCl, 0.33% NaCl
<br>Hypertonic: D20, 3% NaCl, D50


<br>Nursing Considerations<br>
<br>encourage drinking of 2-3 liters per day
<br>note falls risk d/t orthostatic hypotension
<br>strict I/O
<br>Diagnostic<br>
<br>CBC, hematocrit, electrolytes
<br>BUN, CK
<br>urine specific gravity
<br>Causes:<br>
<br>output &gt; input (e.g. running marathons)
<br>inability to ingest fluids
<br>diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea, GI bleed, excessive sweating, third space losses
<br>burns
<br>Risk Factors<br>
<br>CKD
<br>central diabetes insipidus -  rare condition that causes excessive thirst and urination
<br>65 and older
<br>dementia (forgets to drink)
<br>Complications<br>
<br>cerebral hypoperfusion
<br>organ failure
<br>cardiac damage
<br><br>What is it<br>
<br>excess of TBW and sodium (total body water)
<br>increase of fluid volume in the extracellular space
<br>intake &gt; needs
<br>Clinical Manifestations<br>
<br>edema, hypervolemia, or both
<br>hypertension, pulmonary congestion, and edema of the extremities

<br>Pulmonary E - tachypnea, worsening dyspnea, pink frothy sputum, hypoxia, and jugular vein distention.


<br>pitting edema, dyspnea, and crackles in lung fields
<br>ascites in liver cirrhosis
<br>increased weight
<br>Labs:

<br>BNP - may be elevated (hormone that indicates cardiac pressure and volume overload); brain natriuretic peptide

<br>normal: &lt;100 pg/mL, above 400 is critical (mostly likely HF)




<br>Treatment<br>
<br>treat underlying cause
<br>low sodium diet, fluid restriction, increase protein
<br>diuretics for edema and fluid
<br>Nursing Considerations<br>
<br>restrict to 2g of sodium per day
<br>restrict to 1.5-2L of fluid per day
<br>weigh daily, assess for edema, heart sounds, lung sounds, VS
<br>Diagnostic<br>
<br>BNP
<br>ECG to rule out cardiac dysfunction
<br>CBC, electrolytes, LFT, Urea, CK
<br>Causes<br>
<br>HF

<br>decreased tissue perfusion =&gt; water retention


<br>Liver Disease = &gt; reduced renal perfusion, results in edema and ascites

<br>ascites - Fluid collects within the peritoneal cavity as a result of liver disease or dysfunction.


<br>Kidney Disease, AKI
<br>Electrolyte or acid-base imbalance
<br>iatrogenic: excessive IV fluids
<br>Polydipsia - excessive ingestion of fluid

<br>inappropriate ADJ, diabetes insipidus, psychogenic


<br>Risk Factors<br>
<br>ESLD, HF, kidney disease
<br>pregnancy, pre-eclampsia
<br><br>normal range: 136-145 mEq/L
<br><br>What is it <a href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn?query=tag:hypernatremia" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span class="" style="display: none;"></span>#hypernatremia</a><br>
<br>greater than 145 mEq/L
<br>excessive fluid is lost through body systems (GI, GU, renal, respiratory)
<br>usually in conjunction with hypovolemia
<br>Clinical Manifestations<br>
<br>usually presented with neuro symptoms (brain is sensitive to sodium imbalance)

<br>confused or exhibit altered sensorium
<br>restlessness, irritability, and twitching of muscles


<br>fatigue, extreme thirst, headache
<br>sleeping issues, tachypnea, and restlessness
<br>hypotension, dry mucous membranes, and decreased skin turgor
<br>Compilations:

<br>cerebral edema =&gt; may lead to brain damage, death
<br>acute kidney failure


<br>Treatment<br>
<br>oral rehydration
<br>treat underlying cause
<br>IVF with NS or balanced crystalloid
<br>correct slowly (reduce by no more 12 mEq/L in 24 hour)
<br>Nursing Considerations<br>
<br>encourage oral fluids
<br>do not administer IVF rapidly - may result in cerebral edema (seizures)
<br>Causes<br>
<br>vomiting, burns, and profuse diaphoresis.
<br>decreased water intake
<br>diuresis caused by: meds, hyperglycemia, or diabetes insipidus
<br>diet: seawater or salt poisoning, or administration of hypertonic intravenous fluids
<br>Risk Factors<br>
<br>gastroenteritis, diabetes, and kidney disease
<br>impaired thirst response, excessive sweating, and medications
<br>65 and older
<br><br>What is it <a href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn?query=tag:hyponatremia" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span class="" style="display: none;"></span>#hyponatremia</a><br>
<br>excess of total body water in relation to total body sodium content
<br>relative to total body fluid:

<br>Euvolemic hyponatremia - increase of TBW without an alteration in body sodium or ECF
<br>Hypervolemic hyponatremia - greater increase in TBW relative to body sodium


<br>can be chronic or acute
<br>Clinical Manifestations<br>
<br>brain is at the highest risk for injury as a consequence of cellular edema

<br>confusion, lethargy or fatigue, seizures, and possibly resulting in death
<br>hyperactive reflexes 
<br>decreased attebtuib


<br>often asymptomatic, but if Na &lt; 115 mEq/dL, more severe neurological manifestations are evident
<br>severe = emergency!
<br>Treatment<br>
<br>treat cause

<br>meds = discontinue if possible; if not, restrict fluids
<br>hypovolemia = administer IVF NS
<br>SIADH (Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) = vasopressin
<br>HF = loop diuretics with sodium restriction


<br>Nursing Considerations<br>
<br>fluid restrictions, high protein diet
<br>educate: athletes drink fluids with electrolytes
<br>constant neuro checks
<br>monitor for edema, p.edema, UOP, I/O
<br>Causes<br>
<br>fluid loss is replaced by sodium-deficient fluids
<br>administration of hypotonic intravenous fluids
<br>Diuretics, NSAIDs, antidepressants =&gt; decrease Na
<br>Physiological:

<br>renal: diuretic
<br>extrarenal: bleeding, burns, diarrhea, vomiting, third spacing of fluids 

<br>third spacing -excessive fluid moves from the intravascular space into the interstitial space




<br>Acute Hyponatremia: within 24 hours, e.g. runner drank water only
<br>Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) - body produces too much ADH
<br>Thiazide Diuretics - increases risk
<br><br>Risk Factors<br>
<br>alcoholism
<br>65 and older
<br>diuretics, antidepressants, NSAIDs
<br>see causes
<br>Systemic Effects<br>
<br>increases risk of osteoporosis = + risk of fractures
<br><br>K - 3.5-5 mEq/L
<br><br>What is it <a href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn?query=tag:hypokalemia" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><span class="" style="display: none;"></span>#hypokalemia</a><br>
<br>normal range for an adult is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L
<br>K is regulated by kidneys
<br>Clinical Manifestations<br>
<br>dysrhythmias
<br>muscle weakness, nausea, abdominal distention, vomiting, muscle cramps, impaired renal function
<br>cardiac: U waves and flattening of the T wave 
<br>symptoms appear when less than 3 mEq/L
<br>Treatment<br>
<br>oral potassium unless the client cannot tolerate 
<br>if severe, IV infusion with 10-20 mEq/hr
<br>if caused by meds, change the meds
<br>Nursing Considerations<br>
<br>oral K can cause Gi discomfort
<br>monitor: mental confusion, hypotension, and cardiac dysrhythmias
<br>Dextrose - increases incidence of hypokalemia due to insulin secretion
<br>IV site - monitor for irritation during infusion
<br>Diagnostic<br>
<br>BMP
<br>spot urine or 24hr urine test to determine kidney K excretion
<br>determine if renal or non-renal (aldosteronism or diuretic administration)
<br>ABG - determine acidosis/alkalosis
<br>ECG
<br>Causes<br>
<br>Renal

<br>diuresis
<br>aldosteronism


<br>GI

<br>decreased intake
<br>vomiting, laxative use, diarrhea


<br>Endocrine:

<br>Cushing's Syndrome - body has too much cortisol
<br>Insulin - moves K from blood into cells


<br>Risk Factors<br>
<br>cardiac and renal disorders
<br>65 and older (more likely to use diuretics, less muscle mass, poor)
<br>Complications<br>
<br>Respiratory failure can result from muscle weakness if severe hypokalemia
<br>fatal dysrhythmias

<br><br>
<br>Outdoor activities in grassy, wooded areas    
<br>Living in or visiting endemic regions (e.g., Northeast, Midwest U.S.)   
<br>Having pets that bring ticks indoors    
<br>Warmer months (late spring to early fall)    
<br><br>
<br>Early localized (3–30 days):    

<br>Erythema migrans ("bull’s-eye rash")        
<br>Fever, chills, headache, muscle and joint aches        


<br>Early disseminated (weeks to months):    

<br>Multiple rashes, facial palsy, meningitis        
<br>Carditis (AV block)        


<br>Late disseminated (months to years):    

<br>Arthritis, especially in large joints        
<br>Neurological symptoms (memory issues, neuropathy)    


<br>per ATI:<br>
Early Lyme disease is characterized by:<br>
<br>fever
<br>influenza-like manifestations<br>
- erythema migrans -  a distinct, progressive, circular or bullseye rash that often develops at the bite site but can also develop at other sites such as the thighs and knees.
<br><br>
<br>Chronic arthritis    
<br>Cardiac complications (e.g., heart block)    
<br>Neurologic deficits    
<br>Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS)

<br>Clinical signs (esp. bull’s-eye rash)    
<br>Serologic testing: ELISA, followed by Western blot    
<br>May take weeks for antibodies to appear    
<br><br>
<br>Early disease: oral antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, amoxicillin)    
<br>Neurologic or cardiac involvement: IV antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone) 
<br>Pain management for arthritis    
<br>No current vaccine (as of now)    
<br><br>
<br>Teach tick prevention: use repellents, wear long sleeves/pants, check skin/pets    
<br>Instruct to remove ticks properly (tweezers, steady upward pull)    
<br>Monitor for signs of systemic involvement    
<br>Stress importance of completing antibiotic regimen    
<br>Supportive care for joint pain or neurologic symptoms

 <br><br>
<br>Incision – Clean, straight cut (e.g., surgical wound).    
<br>Laceration – Irregular, torn wound (e.g., from trauma).    
<br>Abrasion – Superficial wound caused by friction (e.g., scraped nee). 
<br>Puncture – Deep, narrow wound caused by a sharp object (e.g., needle stick).    
<br>Avulsion – Tissue torn away from its normal location (e.g., degloving injury).    
<br>Ulcer – Open sore due to prolonged pressure or circulation issues (e.g., pressure ulcer).    
<br>Burn – Tissue damage from heat, chemicals, electricity, or radiation.
<br><br>
<br>Primary Intention    

<br>Edges are approximated (closed) with sutures, staples, or glue.     
<br>Minimal scarring and healing occurs quickly.        
<br>Example: Surgical incision.        


<br>Secondary Intention    

<br>Wound heals from the inside out; left open to heal naturally.        
<br>Granulation tissue forms, followed by epithelialization.        
<br>Higher risk of infection and more scarring.        
<br>Example: Pressure ulcers, burns, large wounds with tissue loss.   


<br>Tertiary Intention (Delayed Primary Closure)    

<br>Wound left open initially, then later closed surgically.        
<br>Used when there is a high risk of infection or contamination.        
<br>Example: Infected surgical wound, abdominal wound with dehiscence.

 <br><br>
<br>Assess neurovascular status regularly: check circulation, movement, sensation (CMS), color, temperature, pulses, cap refill.    
<br>Elevate the casted limb above heart level for the first 24–48 hours to reduce swelling.    
<br>Turn the patient every 2 hours if in a body cast to prevent skin breakdown.    
<br>Keep the cast dry if it’s not waterproof — cover with plastic when bathing.    
<br>Use the palm of your hands (not fingers) to handle a wet plaster cast to prevent indentations.    
<br>Report signs of complications: numbness, tingling, severe pain, swelling, foul odor, drainage, or cool/pale skin.    
<br>Encourage movement of fingers/toes distal to the cast to maintain circulation.    
<br>Apply ice packs to the cast over a towel for the first 24–48 hrs to reduce swelling (if approved).    
<br><br><br>
<br>Don’t insert objects (like pens or coat hangers) into the cast to relieve itching — risk of injury and infection.    
<br>Don't insert cotton wipe to dry inside cast - use blow dryer on COOL setting instead
<br>Don’t get the cast wet, unless it's made of water-resistant material.   
<br>Don’t cover a wet cast with plastic — it traps heat and moisture and may cause skin damage.    
<br>Don’t ignore foul smells or drainage — these could be signs of infection or pressure ulcers under the cast.    
<br>Don’t bear weight on the cast unless it’s a walking cast and the doctor says it’s okay.    
<br>Don’t trim or pull apart edges of the cast — always consult a provider if the cast is uncomfortable or damaged.

 <br>
<br>chronic metabolic bone disorder resulting low bone density
<br>the rate of bone resorption (osteoclast cells) exceeds the rate of bone formation (osteoblast cells)
<br>results in fragile bone tissue and can lead to fractures
<br>progressive deterioration of bone tissue
<br>Often asymptomatic until a fracture occurs (common fracture site: wrist, hips, spine)
<br>Osteopenia - precursor to osteoporosis; low bone mineral density relative to the client’s age and sex; bone density peaks at 18-30, decreases gradually, significant decrease in postmenopausal women<br><br>
<br>Aging (natural loss of bone mass over time)
<br>Hormonal changes (especially estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women)
<br>Males: loss of testosterone =&gt; decreased bone mass
<br>Nutritional deficiencies (calcium, vitamin D)
<br><br>Non-Modifiable:<br>
<br>Female sex (higher risk than males)
<br>Aging (risk increases after 50)
<br>Family history of osteoporosis or fractures
<br>Caucasian or Asian ethnicity
<br>History of malabsorption disorders (celiac disease, anorexia, bariatric surgery)
<br>male with decreased T levels
<br>Modifiable:<br>
<br>Low calcium and vitamin D intake
<br>Sedentary lifestyle (lack of weight-bearing exercise)
<br>Excess alcohol (decreased bone formation and increased bone absorption)
<br>Excess Caffeine consumption =&gt; increased excretion of calcium in the urine.
<br>Smoking (reduces bone mass)
<br>Long-term corticosteroid use (e.g., prednisone)
<br>Low body weight or eating disorders
<br>High protein or low protein diet
<br>frequent sodas or carbonated drinks - High phosphorus intake increases the rate of calcium loss
<br><br>
<br>Often asymptomatic until a fracture occurs
<br>Loss of height over time (due to vertebral compression fractures)
<br>Kyphosis (hunched back, "dowager’s hump")
<br>Back pain from vertebral fractures
<br>Fragility fractures (hip, wrist, vertebrae) from minimal trauma
<br><br>
<br>Fractures (hip, spine, and wrist most common)
<br>Chronic pain and disability from fractures
<br>Loss of independence (due to mobility issues)
<br>Increased mortality (hip fractures linked to higher mortality rates)
<br><br>
<br>Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Testing (via DEXA scan); T-score ≤ -2.5 confirms osteoporosis
<br>Serum calcium, vitamin D levels (to assess deficiencies)
<br>X-rays (for fractures)
<br>24 hr urine = check 
<br><br>Lifestyle Modifications:<br>
<br>Increase calcium intake (1200 mg/day postmenopausal women)
<br>Vitamin D supplements (800-1000 IU/day) =&gt; increases calcium absorption
<br>Weight-bearing exercises (walking, resistance training)
<br>Smoking cessation &amp; limiting alcohol intake
<br>limit caffeine
<br>Medications:<br>
<br>Bisphosphonates (first-line):
<br>Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid (inhibit bone resorption) =&gt; take before breakfast with 8oz water, remain upright for 30 min
<br>Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) (e.g., raloxifene) =&gt; replace estrogen due to menopause (note: high risk of breast, endo cancer, DVT)
<br>Denosumab (monoclonal antibody) for high-risk patients
<br>Calcitonin (less commonly used)
<br>Parathyroid hormone analogs (teriparatide) (stimulates bone formation)
<br>Orthotic Devices - immobilization of the spine immediately after a compression fracture of the spine<br>
Surgery: joint repair, vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty<br><br>
<br>Educate on fall prevention (home safety modifications, proper footwear, clear walkways, adequate lighting, etc)

<br>Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake
<br>Teach correct administration of bisphosphonates (take on an empty stomach with water, stay upright for 30-60 min)
<br><br>
<br>Foods rich in vitamin D are most fish, egg yolks, fortified milk, and cereal.
<br>Foods rich in calcium are milk products, green leafy vegetables, fortified orange juice and cereals, red and white beans, and figs. Some soy and rice products are fortified with vitamin D and calcium.

 <br><br>
<br>is a type of radiation therapy during which the radiation source is in direct contact with the client's tumor. 
<br>DIFFERENT FROM CHEMO - chemo is directed throughout the whole body
<br>MORE precise therapy - directly into cancer cells
<br>During the therapy, the client emits radiation and is potentially hazardous to others. The client should be in a private room with a private bathroom, and the nurse should keep the door to the client's room closed.
<br>PER ATI:<br>
<br>2-5 treatment, one or twice a week
<br>no restriction on proximity - no excreted radiation between treatments (you can stand close to them)
<br>there should be no blood - report immediately if there is!
<br>patient will stay still
<br><br>
<br>Systemic treatment using cytotoxic drugs to destroy or inhibit cancer cell growth
<br>Administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intrathecally
<br>Contraindications:<br>
<br>Severe immunosuppression    
<br>Active infection    
<br>Organ dysfunction (e.g., liver or kidney failure)    
<br>Pregnancy (specific agents may be contraindicated)
<br>Nursing Tasks<br>
<br>Administer chemotherapy safely following protocols and PPE guidelines    
<br>Monitor for immediate reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, infusion site issues)    
<br>Assess for side effects such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, or myelosuppression    
<br>Provide patient education on side effect management and treatment schedule    
<br>Ensure proper handling, disposal, and spill management of cytotoxic agents
<br>Nursing Considerations<br>
<br>Monitor CBC, renal, and liver function before and during treatment    
<br>Assess for signs of infection, bleeding, or anemia    
<br>Implement supportive care measures (e.g., antiemetics, hydration, pain control)    
<br>Educate on neutropenic precautions and infection prevention  
<br>AVOID DIRECT SUNLIGHT! - skin on radiation path is sensitive to sun damage
<br>Provide emotional support and address psychosocial concerns
<br>Chemotherapy Combination Meds - Different chemotherapeutic agents act at various stages of cellular mitosis (division). By combining agents, medication therapy is more effective in stopping or slowing the growth of cancerous cells by interfering with their ability to multiply.<br><br>
<br>Do NOT remove the markings - they are guides for treatment - important for accuracy!
<br>use hands instead of wash cloth in doing skin care - skin is sensitive during therapy
<br>avoid direct sunlight for at least 6 months
<br>skin is more sensitive to burns

 <br><br>
<br>A long-term intravenous (IV) access device inserted into a peripheral vein (usually the basilic, cephalic, or brachial vein) and advanced to the superior vena cava.

<br>Used for long-term medication administration, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and frequent blood draws.


<br><br>
<br>Long-term IV therapy (e.g., antibiotics, chemotherapy).

<br>Parenteral nutrition when enteral feeding is not possible.
<br>Frequent blood sampling to minimize vein trauma.
<br>Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring in some cases.


<br><br>
<br>Local infection or vascular abnormalities at the insertion site.    
<br>Thrombosis or occlusion in target veins.    
<br>End-stage renal disease (preferably preserving veins for future dialysis access).    
<br><br>
<br>Dressing Changes:    

<br>Use aseptic technique (sterile gloves, chlorhexidine prep).        
<br>Change transparent dressing every 7 days (or if soiled).        


<br>Flushing Protocol:    

<br>Use 10 mL saline before and after use to prevent occlusion.        
<br>Heparin flush per facility policy (often for non-valved catheters).


<br>Blood Draws:    

<br>Discard 5 mL blood before sampling.<br>
- Flush with 20 mL normal saline post-draw.        


<br>Assessment:    

<br>Check for redness, swelling, drainage, or pain at the site.        
<br>Measure and document external catheter length to detect migration.        


<br>Patient Education:    

<br>Avoid heavy lifting with the affected arm.        
<br>Do not submerge in water (cover during showers).        


<br><br>
<br>Infection Prevention: Monitor for signs of local (redness, swelling) and systemic infection (fever, chills).    
<br>Clot Prevention: Flush regularly and assess for sluggish flow or resistance.    
<br>Catheter Migration: Sudden difficulty flushing or aspiration may indicate dislodgment.    
<br>Air Embolism Prevention: Clamp the catheter when not in use, and place the patient in Trendelenburg if air embolism is suspected.    
<br>Regular monitoring and proper care reduce the risk of complications such as infection, thrombosis, or catheter migration.]]></description><link>https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/Z - Misc Topics/Lines Drains/Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Med-Surg/Z - Misc Topics/Lines Drains/Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC).md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RPB]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 20:23:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Venous Access Port]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>Stages:<br>
<br>Early Stage: Loss of mobility, reduced desire/ability to eat or drink, cognitive changes (delirium, increased sleep).
<br>Middle Stage: Further mental decline, brief wakefulness, "death rattle" from mucus/saliva pooling due to weak cough reflex.
<br>Late Stage: Fever, apnea, mottled skin from peripheral circulation loss; progression varies from 24 hrs to over 14 days.
<br>Good Death: Typically pain-free, in a preferred location, surrounded by loved ones.<br>
<br>Clinical Death: Heart/lungs stop, but brain remains viable; timely CPR may restore function. Brain damage starts after 4 min without oxygen, death in 4-6 min.
<br>Biologic Death (Brain Death): No brain activity or blood flow; diagnosed by apnea, absent brainstem reflexes, coma from known cause.
<br>Causes of Biologic Death: Intracranial (subarachnoid hemorrhage, TBI) or extracranial (cardiac arrest, inadequate CPR, trauma, drowning, overdose, stroke, aneurysm).
<br>Pathophysiology of Biologic Death: Brain oxygen deprivation → increased edema → raised intracranial pressure → reduced cerebral perfusion → herniation.
<br>Organ Donation: Mechanical support can maintain lung/heart function, but brain death is required for organ donation eligibility.
<br><br>
<br>General Changes: Profound weakness, fatigue, increased sleep, disorientation, visions of deceased individuals.
<br>Food &amp; Fluids: Decreased interest in eating/drinking, weight loss, dehydration, difficulty swallowing (choking/coughing).
<br>Urinary Function: Decreased output, urinary incontinence, dark concentrated urine due to low fluid intake.
<br>Skin Changes: Mottling (purple/dark pink in lighter skin, brown in darker skin), pressure injuries from immobility and poor perfusion.
<br>Cardiac &amp; Circulation Changes: Reduced cerebral perfusion (drowsiness, confusion, terminal delirium), peripheral cyanosis, mottling, hypotension, tachycardia, cooling extremities.
<br>Respiratory Changes: Pooling secretions causing "death rattle," weak/absent cough reflex, dyspnea, Cheyne-Stokes respirations (shallow, rapid breathing with apnea periods).
<br><br>
<br>Absence of resp, HR, responsiveness, voluntary movement, muscle function, and nervous system activity
<br>Complete muscle relaxation
<br>Algor mortis causes body cooling, pale skin, and loss of turgor
<br>Rigor mortis causes muscle stiffness, beginning within 2-6 hours and peaking at 12 hours
<br>Livor mortis causes blood pooling in dependent areas, leading to purple or reddish discoloration, which becomes fixed after 6-12 hours
<br><br>
<br>
Specialized care for clients with serious illnesses to improve quality of life.

<br>
Treatment Approach: Can include symptom management alongside or instead of curative treatments.

<br>
Client Support: Helps clients understand treatment options and make informed choices.

<br>
Interprofessional Team: Includes nurses, social workers, dietitians, chaplains, and providers; tailored to client needs.

<br>
Goals: Supports clients in living actively until death, focusing on comfort and symptom control.

<br>
Common Symptoms Managed: Dyspnea and pain are primary concerns.

<br>
Early Implementation Benefits: More effective when started early, reducing unnecessary hospitalizations.
Palliative Sedation

<br>
Used for terminally ill or actively dying clients with distressing symptoms

<br>
Relieves pain, agitation, and anxiety to prevent unnecessary suffering

<br>
Not intended to hasten death

<br>
Common medications: opiates, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics

<br>
Risks: respiratory depression, aspiration, delirium-related agitation

<br>
Requires informed consent from the client or legal proxy

<br>
Must align with advanced directives if applicable

<br><br>
<br>Definition: Focuses on comfort, quality of life, and support for clients nearing the end of life.
<br>Eligibility: For clients with a terminal illness, typically with a prognosis of fewer than six months, though it can be extended.
<br>Care Approach: Provides comfort care rather than curative treatment.
<br>Settings: Can be provided at home, in hospitals, hospice centers, or nursing homes.
<br>Interprofessional Team: Offers medical, emotional, physical, spiritual, and social support.
<br>Home Hospice: Primarily managed by family and friends with hospice team support.
<br>Respite Care: Temporary relief for caregivers to prevent burnout.
<br>Nursing Role: Collaborates with clients, families, and the care team to honor patient wishes and provide education.
<br>Palliative vs. Hospice Care Comparison<br>
<br>Palliative Care:

<br>Provided alongside curative treatments or as symptom management
<br>Can begin at any stage of a serious illness
<br>Aims to improve quality of life and relieve symptoms
<br>Available in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes


<br>Hospice Care:

<br>For clients with a terminal illness, typically with a prognosis of ≤6 months
<br>Focuses on comfort rather than curative treatment
<br>Provided at home, in hospice centers, hospitals, or nursing homes
<br>Primarily managed by family with hospice team support


<br>Both:

<br>Aim to improve quality of life
<br>Use an interprofessional team for medical, emotional, social, and spiritual support
<br>Manage symptoms such as pain and dyspnea
<br>Respect client autonomy and end-of-life wishes


<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Identifying Potential Donors:

<br>Clients must meet brain death criteria (irreversible loss of all brain function).
<br>Brain death is confirmed through apnea, known-cause coma, and absent brainstem reflexes.
<br>Clients near death (not brain dead) may still be assessed for potential donation.


<br>Organs &amp; Tissues Eligible for Donation:

<br>Organs: Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, pancreas, intestines.
<br>Tissues: Corneas, middle ear, heart valves, bone, veins, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, skin.
<br>Other Donations: Hands, face, bone marrow, cord blood, blood stem cells, blood, platelets.
<br>Live Organ Donation: One kidney, one lung, part of the liver, pancreas, or intestine.


<br>Assessment &amp; Scoring:

<br>CGS: Score of 3 with the absence of at least three brainstem reflexes indicates imminent brain death.
<br>FOUR Score: Evaluates respiration, eye response, brainstem response, and motor response (score of 0 suggests brain death).


<br>Nurse’s Role in Brain Death &amp; Donation Process:

<br>Assess and document brainstem reflexes and neurological status.
<br>Maintain circulation and respiratory function with mechanical ventilation and vasopressors.
<br>Work closely with the organ donation coordinator to evaluate donor suitability.
<br>Shift care focus from treatment of the client to organ preservation.


<br>Priorities in Donor Care:

<br>Maintain a patent airway and normal body temperature.
<br>Ensure adequate oxygenation and perfusion of organs.
<br>Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance to prevent complications.


<br>Family Communication &amp; Support:    

<br>Nurses play a key role in discussing organ donation due to their relationship with the family.
<br>Use clear, compassionate communication, explaining brain death and prognosis.
<br>Respect cultural and spiritual beliefs regarding death and organ donation.
<br>Families are more likely to consent when they experience compassion, commitment, and clear information.


<br>Education &amp; Training for Nurses:    

<br>Ongoing training on organ donation, brain death criteria, grief counseling, and facility protocols.
<br>Sensitivity to the death and dying process is crucial.


<br><br>
<br>Pain &amp; Symptom Management: Assess and manage pain, dyspnea, agitation, and secretions using medications (opioids, benzodiazepines, anticholinergics).
<br>Comfort Care: Reposition frequently, provide skin care, and use moisture barriers to prevent breakdown. Keep the client clean, dry, and comfortable.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Primary Triage - in the field
<br>Secondary - at ED, triage nurse assigns 3 or 5 tier categories
<br>Tertiary - when the client exits the ED and is moved into the ICU or operating room
<br><br>
<br>Emergent - life-threatening illness or injury
<br>Urgent - treatment can be delayed, not immediately life-threatening
<br>Delayed - minor injuries or illnesses, higher priority patients are dealt with first
<br><br><br>Patient assessment<br>
<br>Primary Survey- ABCDE
<br>Secondary Survey - Head to Toe assessment
<br>Tertiary Survey - final step to uncover injuries that have been missed =&gt; anytime and before hospital discharge
<br><br>
<br>External Regulations in Nursing: state laws

<br>Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) - law that prevents refusing care to uninsured patients
<br>EMTALA: patients need to be stabilized first before transferring to another facility
<br>EMTALA - exception during during disasters, patients can be transferred without being stabilized first
<br>all documentation should be transferred with the patient
<br>SEXUAL ASSAULT<br>
<br>fear of being stigmatized =&gt; #1 reason why victims do not report

<br><br>
<br>hazard vulnerability analysis, Emergency Operations Plan - required by joint commission
<br>PPE Shortage - reuse them by cleaning, do not conserve: PPE usage is still required
<br>Phases:<br>
<br>Planning - risk assessment, identifying hazards, creating disaster plan

<br>preop - begins as soon as client is scheduled for surgery
<br>intraop
<br>postop - ends with transfer or discharge
<br>Nurse primary role: advocate<br>Classification of Surgical Procedures:<br>By Purpose:<br>
<br>diagnostic
<br>ablative - remove body part or tissue to destroy it (colectomy, removal of tumors)
<br>palliative - provides relief/lessen pain
<br>constructive - restore lost function that was present in birth
<br>restorative/reconstructive - repair or restore a missing body part/organ
<br>transplant
<br>cosmetic
<br>Seriousness:<br>
<br>major - risky
<br>minor
<br>Urgency:<br>
<br>emergent - ASAP, within minutes
<br>urgent - life-saving, within hours of presentation
<br>expedited - not emergency, within days
<br>elective - not urgent, based on convenience
<br>ASA Physical Class system<br>
<br>Class I-VI (healthy to braindead)

<br>Class I - normal healthy adult
<br>Class II - mild medical condition
<br>Class V - critical condition who will die w/o procedure
<br>Class VI - brain dead, organs to be donate


<br>AORN Perioperative Patient Focused Model:<br>
<br>4 dimensions: Health System, Safety, Behavioral Responses and Physiological Responses.
<br><br>Informed Consent:<br>
- needs:<br>
- procedure, potential risks, type of anesthesia, type of anesthesia, risk of anesthesia, any other potential procedures during surgery, postop plan, potential complications, risk and benefits, complications to client<br>
- provider explains and obtains, nurse verifies and witnesses informed consent<br>
- family member or guardian if patient is unconscious or mentally incompetent<br>Preop Tasks:<br>
<br>medical surgical hx obtained, check allergies
<br>baseline head-to-to, VS, height, weight
<br>prep skin: avoid shaving if possible
<br>NPO and meds
<br>hygiene, remove all jewelry
<br>remove nail polish to notice signs of cyanosis
<br>don surgical gown and cap, slippers
<br>Preop Diagnostic Tests:<br>
<br>CBC, Hgb, Hct
<br>Coags: PT, INR, aPTT, platelet
<br>Metabolic: electrolyte, ck, BUN
<br>HCG, urinalysis
<br>CXR, ECG
<br>Bloodtype &amp; screen: if possibility of heavy bleeding (hip replacement)
<br><br>
<br>phase start/end: operating table to PACU/ICU
<br>Nurse role: circulating/scrub

<br>know type of surgery &amp; anesthesia
<br>assist, client positioning
<br>maintain aseptic environment, document, monitor complications


<br><br>
<br>phase start/end: PACU until recovery from procedure
<br>pain assessment- begins in preop stage to establish baseline pain
<br>Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)<br>
<br>surgical protocol implemented to drive client-centered process postoperatively to improve client outcomes
<br>must involve whole team
<br>focuses: mobility, nutrition, pain, manage N/V, discontinue IV fluids ASAP, continue client education
<br><br>
<br>begins in preop stage
<br>teach specific equipment, medications, recovery exercises (breathing, coughing, spirometer, leg exercises, position changes), pain management, coping techniques, etc.
<br>Diaphragm Breathing Exercise<br>
<br>lie supine, hands on stomach, inhale nose, exhale pursed lips, repeat 5 times
<br>Deep Breathing Exercise<br>
<br>sit back, inhale 4 seconds nose, hold breath for 8 seconds, exhale 8 seconds  pursed lips, repeat 3 times
<br>Incentive Spirometer<br>
<br>sit, set goal marker, breath in, once goal reached, hold for as long as possible
<br>exhale slowly, pause then repeat 10 times
<br>done every hour for 10 times
<br>Postop Education Topics:<br>
<br>proper nutrition
<br>meds
<br>lifestyle
<br>wound care
<br>follow-up
<br><br>
<br>Malignant Hyperthermia - genetic disorder triggered by anesthesia/succinylcholines, life-threatening

<br>treatment: dantrolene
<br>tachycardia, tachypnea, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperkalemia, hypercarbia, and muscular rigidity.


<br>Note: postop clients are at increased risk of:

<br>delayed wound healing
<br>infection
<br>increased length of stay
<br>aspiration
<br>DVT


<br>Note: OSA = higher risk of difficult intubation
<br>Note: PACU priority: maintain airway and respiratory status
<br>Note: cardiac postop = increased risk for hypothermia
<br>Dehiscence Treatment: cover with sterile dressing soaked in saline and then notify provider

<br>prevention: limit vomiting, coughing, constipation


<br>Aldrete Score - scoring system determines if patient can be safely discharged  from PACU

<br>must be 8-10 for discharge
<br>criteria: oxygenation, RR, circulation, LOC, activity


<br><br>
<br>similar to periop nursing
<br>nurse provides support, care, fluids, and blood if ordered and monitors the client closely for organ rejection
<br>Note precautions: immunocompromised from the medications and procedures
<br>Note: critical time in first 24 hours after transplant
<br>main complication: rejection of organ
<br>Types of Organ Rejection:<br>
<br>Hyperacute rejection - minutes or hours after transplantation, caused by antibodies
<br>Acute rejection - caused by certain lymphocytes that detect antigens in the transplanted tissue or organ days or weeks after transplantation
<br>Chronic rejection - months or years following organ or tissue transplantation.

 <br>
<br>1 second = 1 mm ÷ (3 cm/min) = 0.2 cm/sec    
<br>So, every 1 mm (small box) on the paper = 10 seconds    
<br>6 small boxes (1 cm) = 60 seconds / 1 minute    
<br>A 10-minute strip is typically 30 cm long
<br>1 Red Line Divider = 1 minute<br>
1 small box = 10 seconds<br><br>Category I: Normal<br>
<br>Baseline rate: 110–160 bpm
<br>Baseline variability: moderate (6–25 bpm)
<br>No late or variable decelerations
<br>Early decelerations: present or absent
<br>Accelerations: present or absent<br>
→ Indicates normal fetal acid-base status; no intervention needed.
<br>Category II: Indeterminate<br>
<br>Includes any tracing not categorized as I or III
<br>Examples:

<br>Bradycardia with variability
<br>Tachycardia
<br>Minimal, absent, or marked variability
<br>Absence of accelerations after stimulation
<br>Recurrent variable decels with minimal/moderate variability<br>
→ Requires close monitoring and clinical evaluation.


<br>Category III: Abnormal - LV "luis vitton" =&gt; late &amp; variable decels<br>
<br>Absent variability and any of the following:

<br>Recurrent late decelerations
<br>Recurrent variable decelerations
<br>Bradycardia


<br>Sinusoidal pattern<br>
→ Indicates abnormal fetal acid-base status; requires prompt intervention (e.g., oxygen, repositioning, delivery if unresolved).
<br><br>
<br>Fluctuations in the baseline FHR that are irregular in amplitude and frequency
<br>Reflects the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems
<br>Key indicator of fetal well-being
<br>1. Absent<br>
<br>No detectable fluctuations
<br>May indicate fetal hypoxia, acidosis, or neurologic depression
<br>Concerning—requires immediate evaluation
<br>prepare for emergency delivery
<br>2. Minimal<br>
<br>Amplitude range: ≤5 bpm
<br>Causes: sleep cycle, sedation (e.g., opioids, magnesium sulfate), prematurity, or hypoxia
<br>Evaluate context and other FHR patterns
<br>3. Moderate (Normal)<br>
<br>Amplitude range: 6–25 bpm
<br>Indicates well-oxygenated fetus with intact CNS
<br>Most reassuring variability
<br>4. Marked<br>
<br>Amplitude: &gt;25 bpm
<br>Causes: acute hypoxia, fetal stimulation, or cord compression
<br>May be transient but warrants monitoring
<br>Moderate variability = reassuring<br>
Absent/minimal = concerning when persistent, especially with decels or bradycardia<br>
Marked = assess for cause, monitor for fetal stress<br><br>1. Early Decelerations<br>
<br>Cause: Head compression (normal response during contractions)
<br>Timing: Mirrors the contraction; nadir aligns with peak
<br>Appearance: Gradual onset/return, uniform shape
<br>Significance: still type 1!, benign, usually not concerning
<br>2. Variable Decelerations<br>
<br>Cause: Umbilical cord compression
<br>Timing: Abrupt onset; varies in timing with contractions
<br>Appearance: Sharp drop (V, U, or W shaped), quick recovery
<br>Significance: May require intervention if recurrent or severe
<br>3. Late Decelerations<br>
<br>Cause: Uteroplacental insufficiency (e.g., hypoxia, hypertension, post-dates)
<br>Timing: Begins after contraction starts; nadir after peak
<br>Appearance: Gradual onset/return
<br>Significance: Concerning—indicates fetal distress, requires evaluation and possible intervention
<br>Late decels = LIONS (L → Left side, I → IV fluids, O → Oxygen, N → Notify provider, S → Stop oxytocin)
<br>4. Prolonged Decelerations<br>
<br>Cause: Interruption in fetal oxygen (e.g., cord prolapse, hypotension, uterine rupture)
<br>Timing: Lasts 2–10 minutes
<br>Appearance: Sharp drop, sustained
<br>Significance: Emergent—requires prompt evaluation and action

<br>
Definition – More than 5 uterine contractions in 10 minutes, averaged over 30 minutes

<br>
Causes – Excessive oxytocin (Pitocin), uterine stimulants, spontaneous labor hyperstimulation

<br>
Risks – Fetal hypoxia, uterine rupture, placental abruption, decreased fetal oxygenation

<br>
Assessment – Frequent contractions with little rest, fetal heart rate changes (late decels, bradycardia), increased uterine tone

<br>
Nursing Interventions

<br>Stop or reduce oxytocin infusion
<br>Reposition mother (left lateral)
<br>Administer oxygen via face mask (8–10 L/min)
<br>IV fluid bolus
<br>Notify provider
<br>Prepare for emergency interventions if unresolved


<br>
Monitoring – Continuous fetal heart rate and contraction pattern via external or internal monitor

 <br>add: +9 months, +7 days<br>Naegele's Rule is a method used to estimate the expected due date of a pregnancy, based on the first day of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP). I<br>common tool for quickly getting a rough estimate of the delivery date, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy. <br>How it Works:<br>Start with the LMP: Identify the first day of the woman's last menstrual period.
Subtract three calendar months: Count back three full calendar months from the LMP date.
Add seven days: Add seven days to the date obtained in step 2.
Add one year (if needed): If the date falls in the previous year, add one year to the date. 
<br>Example:<br>
Let's say the first day of a woman's LMP was September 9, 2023. <br>Subtract three months: September - 3 months = June.
Add seven days: June 9 + 7 days = June 16.
Add one year (if needed): Since the date is in the current year (2024), we don't add a year. 
<br>Therefore, the estimated due date would be June 16, 2024]]></description><link>https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/OB/i. Maternal Assessment/Naegel's Rule.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">OB/i.

<br>
Fetal Breathing Movements:

<br>2 = ≥1 episode ≥30 seconds in 30 mins
<br>0 = Absent or &lt;30 seconds


<br>
Fetal Movement:

<br>2 = ≥3 discrete body/limb movements
<br>0 = &lt;3 movements


<br>
Fetal Tone:

<br>2 = ≥1 episode of flexion-extension-return (e.g., hand or limb)
<br>0 = Slow return or no movement

<br>Pre-test – Explain procedure, empty bladder, semi-Fowler position, apply belts
<br>Documentation – Note start time, client info, reason, vitals, baseline strip (15–30 min)
<br>During test – Watch for fetal movement with HR accelerations
<br>Interpretation – Reactive = 2 accelerations (15 bpm × 15 sec in 20 min)
<br>Nonreactive – No 15×15 accelerations after 40 min → possible distress/IUGR
<br>Follow-up – May need BPP or further testing
<br>Post-test – Help off table, give fluids, restroom, review results and warning signs, 
<br>Nonstress Test (NST) – Interpretation<br>
<br>Reactive (normal) – ≥2 accelerations in 20 minutes, each ↑15 bpm for ≥15 sec (≥32 wks)    
<br>Reactive (before 32 wks) – ≥2 accelerations ↑10 bpm for ≥10 sec in 20 minutes    
<br>Nonreactive – Lacks sufficient accelerations; may indicate fetal sleep, immaturity, or distress    
<br>Follow-up for nonreactive – Extend test to 40 min, use vibroacoustic stimulation, consider BPP or CST    
<br>Significance – Reactive = reassuring; Nonreactive = requires further assessment

<br>refers to Rh incompatibility or ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus    
<br>Can lead to maternal immune response against fetal red blood cells, causing hemolysis
<br>ABO compatibility is LESS important than RH in fetus-mother
<br><br><br>
<br>Rh-negative mother with Rh-positive fetus → maternal immune system produces anti-D antibodies    

<br>in most cases - first born RH+ infants are not affected because of short exposure period
<br>risk increases with each pregnancy =&gt; each infant is more anemic


<br>Less commonly, ABO incompatibility (mother is type O, fetus is A or B)

<br><br>
<br>Hemolysis of fetal red blood cells    

<br>If a mom is Rh-negative and her baby is Rh-positive, her body can get "tricked" into thinking the baby’s red blood cells are invaders. So, her immune system makes anti-D antibodies that can attack and destroy the baby's Rh-positive blood cells, like tiny soldiers fighting what they think is a threat.

 <br>Fetal Development<br>
<br>measured n number of weeks
<br>pregnancy duration is 40 weeks from time of fertilization = 9 months or 266-280 days
<br>Stages of Human Development:<br>
<br>Zygotic Stage - fertilization of sperm and egg through the second week.
<br>Blastocyst Stage - Zygote divides into a solid ball of cells which attaches to the uterus.

<br>outer layer of cells around the blastocyst is known as trophoblast (eventually becomes the placenta)
<br>inner cells of the blastocyst form the fetus


<br>Embryonic Stage - major organs and structures begin to emerge 

<br>begins at Day 15 to week 8
<br>Amniotic sac = maintians body temp of fetus, cushion, promote fetal movement
<br>oligohydramnios - &lt;500 ml, low amniotic fluid volume =&gt; high risk of surgical birth, low BW infant
<br>hydramnios - &gt;2000ml, associated with maternal diabetes, neural tube defects, chromosomal deviations, etc


<br>Fetal Stage - differentiation and structures specialize by end of the eighth week until birth 
<br>HCG - Human Chroionic Gonadotropin <br>
<br>a hormone that ensures that the endometrium will be receptive to the implanting embryo.
<br>signals corpus lutem not to degenerate until placenta secretes adequate hormones
<br>present 3 days after conception
<br><br>Placenta - develops at end of 2nd week, complete by week 12<br>
<br>protects fetus from immune attack by mother
<br>removes waste, regulates hormones
<br>depends on maternal BP =&gt; impaired function if there is obstruction of blood
<br>Serving as the interface between the mother and fetus
<br>Making hormones to control the physiology of the mother to ensure fetus is supplied with nutrients and oxygen needed for growth
<br>Inducing the mother to bring more food to the placenta
<br>Producing hormones that mature into fetal organs
<br>Causes of Decreased Placental Blood Flow:<br>
<br>Vasoconstriction or hypertension – maternal blood vessels constrict due to chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, smoking, or drug use (e.g., cocaine), reducing uteroplacental perfusion    
<br>Decreased maternal blood pressure or cardiac output – maternal hypotension, cardiac disease, hemorrhage, epidural-induced hypotension, or shock reduce overall blood volume and delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the placenta    
<br>Supine hypotension – gravid uterus compresses inferior vena cava when mother lies flat, decreasing venous return and cardiac output, leading to reduced placental perfusion    

<br>=&gt; have mom lay on the side


<br>Excessive maternal exercise – prolonged intense activity diverts blood flow to skeletal muscles and away from uterus and placenta, transiently decreasing oxygen and nutrient delivery to the fetus
<br>Decreased blood flow to fetus:<br>
<br>intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or small for gestational age infant (IGA)

<br>weighs less than the 10th percentile for gestational age due to prolonged reduction in placental blood flow, leading to lower birth weight and potential long-term health effects


<br>Placental Barrier - fetal tissues that prevent the fetus and mother's blood from mixing<br><br>
<br>Human Chorionic gonadotropin – preserves corpus luteum and progesterone, to maintain endometrium, basis of pregnancy tests    
<br>Prolactin – regulates insulin production and sensitivity, supports lactation    
<br>Human placental lactogen – modulates metabolism, develops maternal breasts, decreases insulin sensitivity to increase fetal nutrition    
<br>Estrogen – enlarges breasts, uterus, genitalia, stimulates myometrial contractility    
<br>Progesterone – maintains endometrium, decreases uterine contractility, stimulates metabolism and breast development, nourishes early conceptus  
<br>Relaxin – vasodilates, regulates hemodynamics, works with progesterone, maintains pregnancy, relaxes pelvic ligaments, softens cervix for birth    
<br><br>
<br>has unique shunts and vessels that close after birth
<br>lung finish developing after birth; fetal lungs are nonfunctional
<br>placenta functions as lungs =&gt; oxygenation and gas exchange
<br>fetal liver - non functioning
<br>Only brain and heart is maintained by fetus
<br>liver &amp; lungs = &gt; maintained by placenta
<br>3 Important Shunts<br>
<br>Ductus venosus — bypasses the liver and connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava.

<br>short cut of the liver
<br>goes from umbilical vein directly to IVC


<br>Ductus arteriosus — bypasses the lungs and connects the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta.
<br>Foramen ovale — bypasses the right ventricle and lungs via an anatomic opening between the right and left atrium.

<br>=&gt; aka hole in the middle of the heart


<br>Umbilicus - 2 arteries, 1 Vein<br>At birth:<br>
<br>foramen ovale closes with 1-2 hours, permanent closure by 6 months
<br>ductus venosus (links IVC with umbilical vein) - closes with clamping of umbilicus
<br>ductus arteriosus - closes within 72 hours after birth, permanent closure at 3-4 weeks (delayed closure results in innocent or functional murmur)
<br>L/S Ratio - helps determine lung maturity (amino only), not used as much<br><br>Formed from the amnion<br>
Lifeline from the mother to the growing embryo<br>
Contains one large vein and two small arteries<br>
Wharton jelly surrounds the vein and arteries to prevent compression<br>
At term, the average umbilical cord is 22 in long and about 1 in wide<br><br>Functions:<br>
Maintain steady thermal environment<br>
Cushion against trauma<br>
Source of oral fluid<br>
Allows the infant freedom of movement<br>Variable decelerations may be present if there is not enough fluid<br>Formed from:<br>
<br>Diffusion of fluids from maternal blood
<br>Fetal urine<br>
Fetus swallows amniotic fluid<br>
Fetus breathes amniotic fluid<br>
Plays a role in lung maturation<br>
Normal volume is 800-1200 ml by term
<br>Oligohydrominos "oligo" - too little amnio, &lt;500 ml<br>
Polyhydraminos = too much &gt;2000 ml (might have kidney issues, check with US then check after delivery)<br>no need to memorize critical periods of embryonic development]]></description><link>https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/OB/ii.

 <br><br>
<br>Key Purpose: Designed to bypass the non-functional fetal lungs and liver, prioritizing oxygenated blood to the brain and heart.
<br>Oxygenation Source: Placenta (maternal blood).
<br>Major Shunts:

<br>Ductus Venosus: Bypasses the liver, shunting oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein directly to the inferior vena cava.
<br>Foramen Ovale: An opening between the right and left atria, shunting oxygenated blood from the right atrium to the left atrium, bypassing the lungs.
<br>Ductus Arteriosus: Connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta, shunting blood from the pulmonary artery away from the lungs into the systemic circulation.


<br>Vessels:

<br>Umbilical Vein (1): Carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus.
<br>Umbilical Arteries (2): Carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus back to the placenta.


<br>Blood Flow Path: Oxygenated blood from placenta  Umbilical vein  Ductus venosus  Inferior vena cava  Right atrium  Foramen ovale  Left atrium  Left ventricle  Aorta (to head/upper body) / Some from right atrium  Right ventricle  Pulmonary artery  Ductus arteriosus  Aorta (to lower body) / Small amount to lungs  Hypogastric (internal iliac) arteries  Umbilical arteries  Placenta.
<br><br>
<br>Underlying Issues: Conditions that compromise uteroplacental function or fetal cardiovascular development.
<br>Examples of Risk Factors/Conditions:

<br>Placental Insufficiency: Reduced blood flow or damage to the placenta (e.g., preeclampsia, chronic abruption, maternal hypertension/diabetes) leading to inadequate oxygen/nutrient exchange.
<br>Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR): Often a consequence of compromised placental function, leading to adaptive fetal circulatory changes (e.g., brain-sparing effect where blood is preferentially shunted to the brain).
<br>Congenital Heart Defects (CHDs): Structural abnormalities of the heart or great vessels that alter normal fetal shunting patterns and blood flow, potentially leading to cardiac strain or inadequate oxygenation (e.g., hypoplastic left heart syndrome, transposition of the great arteries).
<br>Fetal Anemia: Reduces oxygen-carrying capacity, forcing the fetal heart to work harder.
<br>Fetal Infection: Some infections (e.g., TORCH) can directly damage the fetal heart or vasculature, impacting circulation.
<br>Persistent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) / Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) after birth: Failure of these fetal shunts to close post-natally leads to abnormal shunting, increased pulmonary blood flow (PDA), or deoxygenated blood entering systemic circulation (PFO with right-to-left shunt).
<br>Pulmonary Hypertension (PPHN): Failure of pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease at birth, leading to persistent shunting away from the lungs (via PFO and PDA), resulting in hypoxemia.


<br>Manifestations of Compromise:

<br>Abnormal Doppler flow studies (e.g., absent/reversed end-diastolic flow in umbilical artery).
<br>Fetal bradycardia or tachycardia (indicating distress).
<br>Hydrops fetalis (fluid accumulation in fetal compartments).
<br>Altered fetal growth.
<br>Abnormal shunting patterns observed on fetal echocardiogram.


<br>Clinical Significance: These high-risk variations require close monitoring and often intervention to optimize fetal well-being or prepare for postnatal management.

 <br>
<br>Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG): Maintains the corpus luteum to ensure continued progesterone production in early pregnancy.
<br>Progesterone: Maintains the uterine lining, relaxes uterine muscles, and prevents preterm contractions.
<br>Estrogen (primarily Estriol): Stimulates uterine growth, promotes uteroplacental blood flow, and prepares the breasts for lactation.
<br>Human Placental Lactogen (hPL) / Human Chorionic Somatomammotropin (hCS): Modifies maternal metabolism to provide nutrients for the fetus and prepares mammary glands for lactation.
<br>Relaxin: Relaxes pelvic ligaments and softens the cervix, aiding in childbirth.
<br>Placental Growth Hormone: Regulates maternal metabolism and fetal growth, becoming predominant later in pregnancy.
<br>Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH): Influences the timing of labor and fetal lung maturation.

 <br>
<br>Amniotic fluid analysis involves assessing fluid obtained from ruptured membranes (spontaneous or artificial) during labor
<br>Helps evaluate fetal well-being, infection, and labor progression
<br><br>
<br>Confirm membrane rupture
<br>Assess fetal lung maturity (if indicated, but usually done antenatally)
<br>Evaluate infection risk (chorioamnionitis)
<br>Identify meconium presence (fetal distress)
<br><br>
<br>Color<br>
Clear/slightly cloudy: normal<br>
Greenish/brown: meconium-stained → possible fetal distress or post-term<br>
Yellow: hemolytic disease (Rh incompatibility)<br>
Red: possible abruption or bleeding
<br>Odor<br>
Foul smell = chorioamnionitis (infection)
<br>Volume<br>
 Oligohydramnios: &lt;500 mL at term → risk of cord compression, growth restriction<br>
 Polyhydramnios: &gt;2000 mL at term → risk of prolapsed cord, preterm labor
<br>pH/Nitrazine test

<br>pH &gt; 6.5 = amniotic fluid (alkaline)
<br>Vaginal secretions = acidic (pH 4.5–5.5)


<br>Ferning test

<br>Microscopic exam shows fern pattern → confirms rupture of membranes


<br>Leukocytes

<br>Elevated WBC (&gt;30/mm³) → infection


<br><br>
<br>Nitrazine paper turns blue if fluid is alkaline (ruptured membranes)
<br>Fern test: Dry fluid on slide → microscopic fern-like crystals
<br>Meconium-stained fluid = fetal stress; may need neonatal resuscitation
<br>Cloudy, foul-smelling fluid = possible infection → start antibiotics
<br><br>
<br>Explain procedure and obtain informed consent if needed
<br>Use sterile gloves when collecting samples to prevent infection
<br>Document color, odor, amount, and time of rupture
<br>Monitor for infection: maternal fever, fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness
<br>Notify provider immediately if meconium is present → risk of meconium aspiration syndrome
<br>Prepare for neonatal resuscitation if meconium-stained fluid
<br>Teach patient to report changes in color, odor, or amount of fluid
<br>Reinforce hand hygiene and peri-care after fluid leaks
<br><br>
<br>Prolonged rupture (&gt;18 hours) → increased risk of infection → monitor for chorioamnionitis
<br>Yellow fluid → think Rh hemolytic disease
<br>Always confirm ferning test before assuming membranes have ruptured
<br>Blue Nitrazine paper alone can yield false positives (e.g., blood, semen) → confirm with ferning test

 <br>Chapter 13 - Ricci Text book<br>
<br>provides information on fetal oxygenation during labor
<br>goal: detect FHR changes early before they are prolonged
<br>can be internal or external
<br><br>
<br>
two ultrasound transducers, each of which is attached to a belt, are applied around the woman’s abdomen

<br>
Tocotransducer - placed over the uterine fundus in the area of greatest contractility to monitor uterine contractions

<br>
Other transducer - baseline FHR, long-term variability, accelerations, and decelerations

<br>placed midline between the umbilicus and the symphysis pubis


<br>
Pros

<br>Noninvasive
<br>Can be used before ROM (membranes intact)
<br>Quick to apply
<br>No risk of uterine perforation or infection
<br>Detects FHR baseline, variability, accelerations, and decelerations
<br>good continuous data


<br>
Cons

<br>limits maternal movement, encourage supine positioning =&gt; reduces placental perfusion
<br>Less accurate FHR detection in obese women
<br>May pick up maternal heart rate artifact
<br>Cannot measure uterine contraction intensity—only frequency and duration
<br>May need frequent repositioning due to fetal/maternal movement
<br>Less reliable in multiples (twins, etc.)


<br><br>
<br>
for higher risk labor: multiple gestation, decreased fetal movement, abnormal FHR, <a data-href="Preeclampsia" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/OB/ii. Pregnancy/High Risk/Hypertensive Disorders/Preeclampsia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Preeclampsia</a>, etc

<br>
spiral electrode into the fetal presenting part, usually the parietal bone on the head

<br>
pressure transducer placed internally within the uterus to record uterine contractions

<br>
Pros

<br>More accurate FHR detection; less artifact
<br>Measures true uterine contraction intensity with IUPC
<br>Not affected by maternal position or movement
<br>Directly records beat-to-beat variability


<br>
Cons

<br>Requires ROM (artificial or spontaneous)
<br>Requires cervical dilation ≥2 cm
<br>Invasive—risk of infection and uterine perforation
<br>Contraindicated in cases of placenta previa, herpes, HIV, hepatitis
<br>Potential fetal injury from electrode placement


<br>CRITERIA FOR INTERNAL MONITORING:<br>
<br>Ruptured membranes
<br>Cervical dilation ≥2 cm
<br>Presenting part engaged (not floating)
<br>No maternal infections (e.g., HIV, herpes)
<br>Skilled provider available

<br>Bradycardia<br>
<br>below 110
<br>Causes: hypoxia, prolonged maternal hypoglycemia, fetal acidosis, administration of analgesic drugs to the mother, hypothermia, anesthetic agents (epidural), maternal hypotension, fetal hypothermia, prolonged umbilical cord compression, and fetal congenital heart block
<br>Tachycardia:<br>
<br>greater than 160
<br>Causes: hypoxia, maternal fever, maternal dehydration, amnionitis, drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine), maternal hyperthyroidism, maternal anxiety, fetal anemia, prematurity, fetal infection, chronic hypoxemia, congenital anomalies, fetal heart failure, and fetal arrhythmias
<br>Can be an ominous sign if it is accompanied by a decrease in variability and late decelerations
<br><br>
<br>clinical indicator that is predictive of fetal acid–base balance and cerebral tissue perfusion
<br>Key indicator of fetal well-being
<br>1. Absent<br>

 <br>
<br>Periodic assessment of fetal heart rate (FHR) using handheld Doppler or fetoscope
<br>Uses ultrasound waves to detect fetal heart echoes
<br>Acceptable for low-risk laboring women
<br>Promotes mobility and physiologic birth
<br><br>
<br>Allows maternal mobility during labor
<br>Less restrictive than continuous EFM
<br>Encourages natural labor progression
<br><br>
<br>Cannot detect variability or types of decelerations
<br>Does not provide a continuous record of fetal status
<br>May miss transient or late decelerations
<br><br>
<br>Use Leopold maneuvers to locate fetal back
<br>Apply water-soluble gel to abdomen
<br>Place Doppler in lower abdominal quadrant (cephalic) or umbilicus level (breech)
<br>Palpate maternal radial pulse to differentiate from maternal HR
<br>Baseline FHR: auscultate for 1 minute after contraction
<br>Routine checks: 30 seconds x 2 (if no changes)
<br><br>
<br>Initial: 10-20 min continuous FHR upon admission
<br>Low-risk active labor: q30min
<br>High-risk active labor: q15min
<br>Second stage low-risk: q15min
<br>Second stage high-risk: q5min
<br>Assess FHR before and after vaginal exams, ROM, meds, ambulation
<br><br>
<br>Monitor FHR after position changes, pain meds, or other interventions
<br>FHR may shift location as fetus descends
<br>Not recommended for undiagnosed high-risk labor
<br>Safe for low-risk women with no evidence of fetal compromise
<br>Does not replace continuous monitoring for high-risk cases
<br><br>
<br>Late decels: best detected by listening at end of contraction
<br>Chorioamnionitis: monitor for maternal fever &amp; fetal tachycardia
<br>Document: FHR baseline, rhythm, rate, and maternal VS
<br>For low-risk patients, no difference in Apgar or outcomes vs. continuous EFM

 <br>
<br>Systematic abdominal palpation technique to determine fetal lie, presentation, position, and engagement    
<br>Essential tool in prenatal assessment starting around 28 weeks gestation    
<br>Helps guide delivery planning and monitor fetal well-being    
<br><br>
<br>First Maneuver (Fundal Grip)    

<br>Palpate top of uterus (fundus) to identify fetal part (head = hard/round/moveable; buttocks = soft/irregular)        


<br>Second Maneuver (Lateral Grip)    

<br>Palpate sides of uterus to locate fetal back (smooth/firm) vs. small parts (limbs, irregular)        


<br>Third Maneuver (Pawlik’s Grip)    

<br>Grasp just above symphysis pubis to determine presenting part (head or breech) and mobility       


<br>Fourth Maneuver (Pelvic Grip)    

<br>Facing mother’s feet, slide hands down sides of uterus to assess fetal descent into pelvis and attitude of head (flexed = easier delivery; extended = possible complications)        


<br><br>
<br>Lie: Relationship of fetus’s spine to mother’s spine (longitudinal/transverse/oblique)    
<br>Presentation: Part of fetus that enters pelvis first (cephalic/breech/shoulder)    
<br>Position: Relationship of presenting part to maternal pelvis (e.g., LOA)    
<br>Attitude: Fetal flexion/extension    
<br><br>
<br>Head = hard, round, moves independently    
<br>Buttocks = soft, irregular, moves with trunk    
<br>Back = smooth, firm    
<br>Limbs = small, irregular, kicking    
<br><br>
<br>Explain procedure to patient; ensure privacy and comfort    
<br>Ask patient to empty bladder to improve accuracy    
<br>Position patient supine with knees flexed and slight head elevation*    
<br>Use warm hands to avoid discomfort    
<br>Perform fetal heart rate monitoring before and after maneuvers to ensure fetal well-being    
<br>Document findings: lie, presentation, position, engagement    
<br>Remember accuracy decreases with obesity, polyhydramnios, anterior placenta, or multiple gestation    
<br><br>
<br>Recognize LOA (left occiput anterior) as most common, optimal position for delivery   
<br>Engagement means the presenting part has passed the pelvic inlet (station 0)    
<br>Flexed head = easier vaginal delivery; deflexed head may cause complications    
<br>Never perform Leopold maneuvers during contractions (wait until relaxation phase)

<br>or both
<br><br>POWERS<br>
<br>Ineffective uterine contractions (hypotonic or hypertonic)    

<br>Hypertonic Uterine Dysfunction - erratic contractions;  irregular, uncoordinated, ineffective =&gt; uterus never fully relaxes between contractions<br>
treatment: sedate, analgesia, hydrate, reposition
<br>Hypotonic Uterine Dysfunction  - Contractions become poor in quality and lack sufficient intensity to dilate and efface the cervix; high risk for hemorrhage<br>
treatment: augment via Pitocin, amniptomy to enchance labor, hydrate


<br>Protracted disorders - very slow dilation and descent
<br>Arrest Disorders - no progress or failure of descent
<br>Precipitate Labor - completed in 3 hours or less; "cannonball baby"<br>
=&gt; too fast of delivery =&gt; cervical lacerations, uterine rupture
<br>PASSENGER<br>
<br>Positioning =&gt; any position other than occiput anterior (head down and anterior facing) = higher risk

<br>Persistent Occiput Posterior - most common

=&gt; can lead to brachial plexus palsy - no nerve control, shoulder is drooping<br>
=&gt; high risk for uterine lacerations, bleeding<br>
=&gt; "turtling" - head of the baby emerging from the birth canal, then retracting back


<br>Multiple Gestation - twins or more (plan for vaginal birth if twins are VERTEX)
<br>Macrosomia - 4kg or more baby
<br>PASSAGEWAY<br>
<br>Pelvis Shape = "Good Anatomy Allows Passage"

<br>Gynecoid - good; best shape, round

 <br>Chapter 13: Labor and Birth Process (Ricci)<br>
Original 5 P's<br>
<br>Passageway
<br>Passenger
<br>Powers
<br>Position
<br>Psychological Response
<br><br>
<br>birth canal
<br>Pelvis: must be at least 11.5 cm diagonal conjugate, true conjugate 10cm or more
<br>Soft Tissues: must efface (thin out)
<br>Pelvic Floor muscles =&gt; help rotate fetus during labor (Kegels!)
<br>Pelvic Shapes:<br>
<br>Gynecoid - "G for Good", best, round shape, roomy outlet
<br>Anthropoid - "Anthro = average", not ideal but better than ANDROID or PLATYPELLOID
<br>Android - "male robot = male pelvis"; funnel shape, not good, usually C-section
<br>Platypelloid (flat) - least common, not good
<br><br>HEAD<br>
<br>largest part
<br>cranial sutures &amp; soft fontanelle = &gt;help head elongate with pressure
<br>overlapping sutures = molding; elongated
<br>Caput succedaneum - edema of the scalp at the presenting part (resolves in 3-4 days)
<br>Cephalohematoma - Collection of blood between the periosteum and the bone that occurs several hours after birth.
<br>Fetal Attitude <br>
<br>posturing or FLEXION or EXTESION of joints
<br>FULL FLEXION - good; more compressed body
<br>FETAL LIE - relationship of long spin to spine of mother<br>LIE to LTO<br>
<br>longitudinal - parallel to maternal spine
<br>transverse 
<br>oblique - fetal long axis is at an angle to the bony inlet
<br>FETAL PRESENTATION - part that is peeking out of the vajayjay<br>
<br>Cephalic - head first; more common<br>
1. Vertex - occipital lobe first; most preferred<br>
2. Military<br>
3. Brow - Largest diameter presents; labor often does not progress; usually requires C-section<br>
4. Face - May cause facial edema, bruising; larger presenting diameter makes vaginal delivery challenging.
<br>Breech - pelvis first; umbilical cord can compress; largest part last; risk for birth trauma, head entrapment, often c-section<br>
Frank Breech - baby's legs are straight up in front, with the feet near the head, and the buttocks present first.<br>
Complete - knees bent<br>
Single Footling - one foot down<br>
Double Footling - two feet down
<br>Shoulder - scapula first; risk for <a data-href="Shoulder Distocia" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/OB/iii. Labor/Complications/Shoulder Distocia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shoulder Distocia</a>, cannot be delivered vaginally; high risk of cord prolapse; requires C-section.<br>
TURTLE SIGN - neonate’s head slowly extends and emerges over the perineum but then retracts back
<br>FETAL POSITION - position in the womb j described by the baby’s head, back, and limbs relative to the mother’s pelvis<br>Jay Loa &amp; Roa = baby's most favorable position<br>Left Occiput Anterior (LOA)- most favorable<br>
Right Occiput Anterior  (ROA) - 2nd most favorable<br>
Posterior (xOP)- least favorable<br>
<br>L or R - left or right
<br>O/S/M/A/D - Occupit, Sacrum, Mentum, Acrominion, Dorsal
<br>A/P/T - anterior, posterior, transverse
<br>FETAL STATION - relationship of the presenting part to the level of the maternal pelvic ischial spines<br>
<br>scale of -4 not +4
<br>-4 not engage, +4 crowning, ready to delivery
<br>0 stations - head aligned with ischial spine in pelvis, considered as "engaged"
<br>FETAL ENGAGEMENT - largest diameter of the fetal presenting part<br>CARDINAL MOVEMENTS OF LABOR - EDFIREEE<br>
<br>Engagement    

<br>Fetal head enters pelvic inlet (0 station)        
<br>Indicates head is engaged and labor is progressing normally        


<br>Descent    

<br>Head moves deeper into pelvis with contractions and maternal effort        
<br>Indicates progression toward delivery; continued descent is necessary for successful vaginal birth        


<br>Flexion    

<br>Fetal chin tucks to chest, presenting the smallest diameter        
<br>Allows for easier passage through the pelvis        


<br>Internal Rotation    

<br>Head rotates to align with the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvis        
<br>Proper rotation reduces risk of prolonged labor and aids in head alignment for delivery        


<br>Extension    

<br>Fetal head extends as it passes under the pubic symphysis        
<br>Facilitates delivery of the head; guides provider to prepare for crowning        


<br>External Rotation (Restitution)    

<br>Head realigns with shoulders after head is delivered        
<br>Allows shoulders to align with pelvis; prepares for shoulder delivery        


<br>Expulsion    

<br>Shoulders and body are delivered        
<br>Marks the completion of delivery and transition to newborn care


<br><br>UTERINE CONTRACTIONS - involuntary; responsible for thinning and dilating cervix<br>
<br>Effacement -  % based on cervical canal length<br>
2 cm = 0%<br>
1 cm = 50%<br>
0 cm = 100%. 
<br>Dilation
<br>Frequency &amp; Duration: early labor =&gt; 30 sections, 5-7 minutes apart
<br>Intensity - measured by internal intrauterine pressure catheter
<br>Contraction Phase:<br>
<br>increment - start to peak
<br>acme - actual peak
<br>decrement - peak to baseline; relaxation of the uterine muscle fibers
<br>INTRA-ABDOMINAL PRESSURE - caused by voluntary muscle contractions<br>
more pressure, the better expulsion<br>
sedation decreases <br><br>
<br>upright maternal positioning uses gravity to bring fetus down, less risk of aorta compression
<br>common practice - adopt maternal position of comfort
<br>peanut ball can decrease time of labor
<br><br>
<br>more emotional support = better

 <br><br>
<br>onset - within minutes and lasts for several hours
<br>complication: respiratory depression
<br>Opioids: morphine, demerol, fentanyl

<br>can cross placenta


<br>Antiemetics: hydroxyzine, promethazine, Compazine
<br>Benzodiazepines<br>
Midazolam/Versed - amnesia effect, adjunct for anesthesia<br>
Diazepam - enhance pain relief, sedation
<br>Inhaled Analgesics - nitrous oxide, self-administered =&gt; empowering, less perception of pain 
<br><br>
<br>local anesthetic agents with or without added opioids to bring about pain relief or numbness through the drug’s effects on the spinal cord and nerve roots
<br>pain relief without loss of consciousness
<br>usually T8 to T10
<br>The woman can participate in the birthing process and still have good pain control
<br><br>
<br>administration of opioids or anesthetics into the epidural or intrathecal space
<br>small catheter is then passed through the epidural needle
<br>Epidural analgesia increases the duration of the second stage of labor
<br>meds: combination of lidocaine anesthetic, opioid analgesic
<br>Contraindication: receiving anticoagulants
<br><br>
<br>indwelling epidural catheter with an infusion of medication and a programmed pump allows patient controlled dosing
<br><br>
<br>injection of local anesthetic into the superficial perineal nerves to numb the perineal area
<br><br>
<br>injection of a local anesthetic agent into the pudendal nerves near each ischial spine
<br>provides pain relief in the lower vagina, vulva, and perineum
<br><br>
<br>injection of an anesthetic “caine” agent with or without opioids into the subarachnoid space
<br>usually used in c-sections
<br>contraindications: bleeding precautions
<br>intrathecal narcotics
<br><br>
<br>state of unconsciousness and insensitivity to pain during surgery
<br>Usually: barbiturate + propofol (unconsciousness) + muscle relaxant
<br>crosses placenta
<br>Complications: fetal depression, uterine relaxation, vomiting/aspiration, inability to intubate
<br>Considerations: ensure NPO, IV line, administer clear oral antacid or <a data-href="PPI and H2 Blockers" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Pharmacology/GI Meds/PPI and H2 Blockers.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PPI and H2 Blockers</a>

<br>Contact: The sensory experiences of touching, holding, and gazing at the infant are part of proximity-seeking behavior.
<br>Emotional state: The emotional state emerges from the affective experience of the new parents toward their infant and the parental role.
<br>Individualization: Parents are aware of the need to differentiate the infant’s needs from themselves and to recognize and respond to them appropriately, making the attachment process also, in a way, one of detachment.

 <br><br>
<br>Blood loss of  after vaginal birth or  after C-section within 24 hours of birth (Primary/Early PPH).
<br>Or, blood loss occurring 24 hours to 6-12 weeks postpartum (Secondary/Late PPH).
<br>A leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide.
<br><br>5 T's<br>
<br>Tone: uterine atony (most common), distended bladder
<br>Tissue: retained placenta and clots; uterine subinvolution
<br>Trauma: lacerations, hematoma, inversion, rupture
<br>Thrombin: coagulopathy (preexisting or acquired)
<br>Traction: too much pulling on umbilical cord
<br><br>
<br>Uterine Atony:

<br>Overdistension of uterus (multiples, polyhydramnios, macrosomia).
<br>Prolonged labor, rapid labor.
<br>Grand multiparity (  pregnancies).
<br>Oxytocin use during labor.
<br>MgSO4 administration.
<br>Chorioamnionitis.


<br>Trauma: Operative vaginal delivery (forceps, vacuum), precipitous delivery, large infant.
<br>Tissue: Placenta previa, accreta, increta, percreta.
<br>Thrombin: Pre-existing bleeding disorders, severe preeclampsia, placental abruption, sepsis.
<br><br>
<br>Early signs: Excessive vaginal bleeding (saturating pads quickly, steady trickle), boggy uterus (not firm).
<br>Late signs (Hypovolemic Shock): Hypotension, tachycardia, pallor, dizziness, oliguria, altered mental status.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Don't wait for signs of shock; recognize and act on early signs of excessive bleeding!
<br><br>
<br>Hypovolemic shock.
<br>Anemia.
<br>Acute kidney injury.
<br>Sheehan's Syndrome (postpartum pituitary necrosis due to severe blood loss).
<br>Peripartum hysterectomy.
<br>Maternal death.
<br><br>
<br>Clinical assessment: Quantify blood loss (weighing pads/chux, collecting blood in calibrated drapes). Visual estimation often underestimates.
<br>Physical exam: Fundal massage, inspection for lacerations, assessment for retained placental fragments.
<br>Laboratory tests: CBC (H&amp;H), type and crossmatch, coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen).
<br><br>
<br>Atony (Fundal Massage &amp; Medications):

<br>First-line: Firm uterine fundal massage.
<br>Uterotonics:

<br>Oxytocin (Pitocin): IV bolus or infusion. NCLEX Tip: Always first-line uterotonic.
<br>Methylergonovine (Methergine): IM. Contraindicated in hypertension/preeclampsia.
<br>Carboprost tromethamine (Hemabate): IM. Contraindicated in asthma.
<br>Misoprostol (Cytotec): Rectal or oral.




<br>Trauma: Repair of lacerations, evacuation of hematomas.
<br>Tissue: Manual removal of retained placenta, D&amp;C (Dilation &amp; Curettage).
<br>Thrombin: Administer blood products (pRBCs, FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate) as indicated.
<br>Surgical intervention: Uterine artery embolization, B-Lynch suture, hysterectomy (last resort).
<br>Fluid resuscitation: IV crystalloids, blood transfusion.
<br><br>
<br>Assess Fundus: Immediately after birth and frequently. Should be firm, midline, at or below umbilicus. If boggy, massage until firm.
<br>Assess Lochia: Quantity, color, presence of clots. Quantify blood loss accurately.
<br>Vital Signs: Monitor every 5-15 minutes in acute hemorrhage. Recognize subtle changes.
<br>Bladder: Ensure bladder is empty (full bladder can displace uterus and prevent contraction). Straight catheterize if needed.
<br>IV Access: Ensure at least two large-bore (18-gauge) IVs for fluid and blood product administration.
<br>Medication Administration: Understand mechanism of action, dosages, routes, and contraindications of uterotonics.
<br>Emotional Support: Keep patient and family informed. Maintain a calm environment.
<br>Team Communication: Alert provider immediately for signs of PPH. Initiate rapid response if indicated.
<br>Post-PPH Care: Monitor for anemia, fatigue. Administer iron supplements as prescribed.
<br><br>
<br>Warning Signs: Educate patient on signs of excessive bleeding (e.g., soaking more than one pad per hour, large clots, dizziness).
<br>Activity: Gradual increase in activity; avoid heavy lifting.
<br>Nutrition: Importance of iron-rich foods to replenish stores (e.g., red meat, leafy greens, fortified cereals).
<br>Rest: Emphasize importance of rest and sleep.
<br>Follow-up: Stress importance of postpartum follow-up appointments.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Teach signs of infection and when to seek immediate medical attention (e.g., fever, foul-smelling lochia).

<br>
Facial symmetry:

<br>Assess for nerve injury (e.g., facial nerve palsy)


<br>

<br>
Craniotabes:

<br>Soft skull bones near suture lines; common in preterm infants; resolves as bones harden


<br>
Subgaleal hemorrhage:

<br>Fluctuant mass that crosses suture lines; requires urgent evaluation due to risk of significant blood loss


<br><br>
<br>Microcephaly

<br>Head circumference &gt;2 SD below average or &lt;10% normal parameters for gestational age<br>

<br>Due to failed brain development, reduced neuron production, reduced brain/skull size<br>

<br>Yellowing of skin and sclera: Appears within 24 hours of birth, may be intense or spread rapidly (cephalocaudal progression).
<br>Other symptoms indicating underlying pathology or complications:

<br>Dark urine (cola-colored) or pale/acholic (clay-colored) stools (suggestive of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia or biliary obstruction).
<br>Lethargy, poor feeding, irritability, high-pitched cry.
<br>Fever.
<br>Vomiting.
<br>Hypo/hypertonia, arching of the back (opisthotonus) - signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy.
<br>Seizures.


<br><br>
<br>Acute Bilirubin Encephalopathy (ABE): Bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier and is toxic to brain cells. Early signs: lethargy, poor feeding, high-pitched cry, hypotonia.
<br>Kernicterus (Chronic Bilirubin Encephalopathy): Irreversible brain damage resulting from prolonged exposure to high bilirubin levels. Can lead to:

<br>Athetoid cerebral palsy (involuntary, uncontrolled movements).
<br>Permanent upward gaze.
<br>Hearing loss.
<br>Enamel dysplasia of teeth.
<br>Intellectual disability.


<br>Anemia (from hemolysis).
<br>Liver damage (if underlying liver disease).
<br><br>
<br>Total Serum Bilirubin (TSB) and Conjugated/Direct Bilirubin levels:

<br>TSB  percentile for age in hours on a nomogram.
<br>Jaundice within 24 hours of life is always pathologic.
<br>Direct bilirubin  or  of TSB is always pathologic and requires immediate workup for cholestasis/liver disease.


<br>Blood type and Coombs test (direct and indirect): To check for ABO/Rh incompatibility.
<br>CBC with differential and reticulocyte count: To assess for anemia and hemolysis.
<br>G6PD screen.
<br>Liver function tests (LFTs).
<br>Thyroid function tests (TFTs).
<br>Urine for reducing substances, cultures (blood, urine, CSF) if infection suspected.
<br>Abdominal ultrasound: If biliary atresia or other structural liver/biliary abnormalities suspected.
<br><br>
<br>Phototherapy: Uses blue-green light to convert unconjugated bilirubin into water-soluble isomers that can be excreted.

<br>Intensity and duration depend on TSB level, age, and risk factors.
<br>May involve single, double, or triple phototherapy.


<br>Exchange Transfusion: Used for extremely high TSB levels, rapid rise despite phototherapy, or signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy. Involves removing small amounts of infant's blood and replacing with donor blood to quickly lower bilirubin and remove antibodies.
<br>Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG): May be used in immune-mediated hemolytic jaundice (e.g., ABO/Rh incompatibility) to reduce antibody-mediated hemolysis and decrease need for exchange transfusion.
<br>Treat underlying cause:

<br>Antibiotics for sepsis.
<br>Surgery for biliary atresia.
<br>Specific treatments for metabolic disorders.


<br>Hydration: Ensure adequate fluid intake (oral or IV) to promote bilirubin excretion.
<br><br>
<br>Monitoring:

<br>Frequent TSB levels: As ordered, plot on nomogram.
<br>Vital signs: Especially temperature (phototherapy can cause hyperthermia) and respiratory rate.
<br>Hydration status: Assess for signs of dehydration (urine output, fontanelles, skin turgor, weight loss).
<br>Feeding patterns: Ensure adequate intake to promote bowel movements.
<br>Neurological status: Monitor for signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (lethargy, poor feeding, high-pitched cry, abnormal tone, seizures).


<br>Phototherapy Care:

<br>Maximize skin exposure: Undress infant (diaper only), ensure maximum surface area exposure to light.
<br>Eye protection: Apply opaque eye patches to prevent retinal damage.
<br>Reposition frequently: To expose all skin surfaces to light.
<br>Maintain thermoregulation: Use radiant warmer/isolette, monitor temperature closely.
<br>Increase fluid intake: Offer frequent feedings or IV fluids to prevent dehydration from increased insensible water loss and promote bilirubin excretion.
<br>Skin integrity: Monitor for rashes, bronzing baby syndrome (rare side effect with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia).
<br>Parent-infant bonding: Encourage parents to remove baby for brief feeding and cuddling breaks if TSB levels allow; otherwise, encourage touch and presence at bedside.


<br>Education: Provide clear explanations to parents about the condition, treatment, and potential complications.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Jaundice within the first 24 hours is always pathologic and requires immediate investigation.
<br><br>
<br>Causes and Importance: Explain that this type of jaundice is serious and caused by specific underlying problems, needing prompt treatment to prevent brain damage (kernicterus).
<br>Phototherapy:

<br>Explain why it's needed and how it works.
<br>Emphasize importance of eye patches and maximizing skin exposure.
<br>Discuss the need for frequent feedings/hydration.
<br>Reassure about the safety of phototherapy.


<br>Signs to Watch For:

<br>Worsening yellow color (especially palms/soles).
<br>Changes in behavior: lethargy, difficulty waking, poor feeding, high-pitched cry, irritability.
<br>Fever.
<br>Dark urine or pale stools.
<br>Any unusual movements or arching.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Always provide written instructions on when to call the provider after discharge (e.g., specific bilirubin level thresholds, worsening jaundice, behavioral changes).


<br>Follow-up: Stress the critical importance of all follow-up appointments for TSB checks and developmental assessments.
<br>Feeding: Encourage frequent and effective feeding (breastfeeding or formula) to promote bilirubin excretion through stools. May need temporary formula supplementation or IV fluids if intake is poor or levels are very high.
<br>No sunlight for treatment: Emphasize that household lights or direct sunlight are not effective or safe treatments for pathologic jaundice.

 <br>
<br>Hemorrhage (bleeding) that occurs in the brain of premature newborns.
<br>Specifically, it involves bleeding into the periventricular (area around the ventricles) and intraventricular (within the ventricles, spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid) regions.
<br>The bleeding originates from the germinal matrix, a highly vascularized and fragile area of the brain found in premature infants, which largely involutes (disappears) by 33-34 weeks gestation.
<br>Graded I to IV based on severity (Papile grading):

<br>Grade I: Hemorrhage confined to the germinal matrix (subependymal).
<br>Grade II: Intraventricular hemorrhage without ventricular dilation.
<br>Grade III: Intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilation (blood fills and expands the ventricles).
<br>Grade IV: Hemorrhage extends into the brain parenchyma (tissue) adjacent to the ventricle (often termed periventricular hemorrhagic infarction).


<br><br>
<br>Fragile Germinal Matrix Vessels: Premature infants have delicate, immature blood vessels in the germinal matrix that are prone to rupture.
<br>Fluctuations in Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF): Premature infants have impaired cerebral autoregulation (ability to maintain stable CBF despite changes in systemic blood pressure). Sudden increases or decreases in systemic blood pressure can lead to rupture of fragile vessels.
<br>Hypoxia-Ischemia: Lack of oxygen or blood flow to the brain can damage vessels.
<br>Reperfusion Injury: After an ischemic event, restoration of blood flow can cause vessel damage and bleeding.
<br><br>
<br>Prematurity: Gestational age  weeks (especially extremely low birth weight infants, ).
<br>Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS): Requires mechanical ventilation, which can cause fluctuations in blood pressure and CBF.
<br>Mechanical Ventilation: Especially if unstable (e.g., rapid changes in ventilatory settings).
<br>Perinatal Asphyxia/Hypoxia.
<br>Rapid changes in blood pressure: Hypotension followed by rapid fluid resuscitation or use of vasopressors.
<br>Acidosis.
<br>Pneumothorax.
<br>Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA).
<br>Sepsis/Infection.
<br>Coagulopathy/Bleeding disorders.
<br>Rapid volume expansion.
<br>Umbilical cord clamping delays.
<br>Traumatic delivery.
<br>Maternal factors: Chorioamnionitis, maternal hypertension (some studies).
<br>NCLEX Tip: The more premature the infant, the higher the risk of PIVH.
<br><br>
<br>Often asymptomatic, especially Grade I/II, detected by screening ultrasound.
<br>Acute Deterioration (more common in Grade III/IV, "saltatory" course):

<br>Apnea and bradycardia (sudden onset).
<br>Pallor.
<br>Cyanosis.
<br>Poor muscle tone (hypotonia).
<br>Weak cry, lethargy.
<br>Bulging or tense fontanelle (indicates increased intracranial pressure).
<br>Seizures (focal or generalized).
<br>Decreased reflexes.
<br>Metabolic acidosis.
<br>Drop in hematocrit.


<br>NCLEX Tip: Be alert for sudden, unexplained changes in a preterm infant's neurological status, breathing pattern, or vital signs.
<br><br>
<br>Hydrocephalus (Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus): Most common complication, especially with Grade III/IV, due to obstruction of CSF flow by blood clots. Requires ventricular taps or shunt placement.
<br>Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL): Damage to the white matter, often due to ischemia or infarction near the hemorrhage, leading to motor deficits.
<br>Cerebral Palsy (CP): Especially spastic diplegia (affecting legs more), related to white matter injury.
<br>Neurodevelopmental Impairment: Cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, behavioral problems.
<br>Seizure disorder.
<br>Vision and hearing impairment.
<br>Death: More common with severe (Grade III/IV) hemorrhage.
<br><br>
<br>Cranial Ultrasound (CUS): Primary diagnostic tool. Non-invasive, bedside, highly effective.

<br>Recommended for all infants  weeks gestation:

<br>At 7-14 days of life (when most bleeds manifest).
<br>Repeat at 4-6 weeks corrected age, or if clinical signs suggest deterioration.
<br>Earlier screening within the first 72 hours for high-risk infants.




<br>MRI: May be used for more detailed evaluation, especially in later follow-up or if CUS is inconclusive.
<br><br>
<br>No specific treatment to stop the bleeding once it occurs.
<br>Supportive Care (primary focus is prevention and minimizing secondary injury):

<br>Stabilize blood pressure: Avoid wide fluctuations (both hypotension and hypertension).
<br>Respiratory support: Optimize ventilation, minimize hypercapnia or hypocapnia.
<br>Maintain normal acid-base balance.
<br>Minimize handling/stress: Cluster care, gentle movements.
<br>Head in midline position: Avoid neck hyperextension/flexion.
<br>Strict fluid and electrolyte management.
<br>Correct coagulopathies.


<br>Management of Hydrocephalus (if develops):

<br>Serial lumbar punctures/ventricular taps: To remove CSF and reduce pressure.
<br>Ventricular reservoir placement: Temporary measure to drain CSF.
<br>Ventricular-peritoneal (VP) shunt: Surgical insertion of a permanent drain from brain to abdomen for CSF drainage.


<br>Neuroprotection (Prevention):

<br>Antenatal Corticosteroids: Administered to mothers at risk of preterm birth (reduces incidence and severity of PIVH).
<br>Delayed cord clamping: May help stabilize CBF.
<br>Avoidance of rapid intravenous fluid boluses.
<br>Indomethacin (for PDA): May reduce PIVH risk, but controversial.


<br><br>
<br>Prevention: Adhere strictly to prevention protocols for preterm infants (e.g., gentle handling, neutral head position, minimal stimulation, careful fluid management).
<br>Neurological Assessment: Frequent and thorough neurological assessments, looking for subtle changes in tone, activity, reflexes, fontanelle, and cry.
<br>Vital Sign Stability: Meticulous monitoring of HR, BP, RR, SpO2. Report significant fluctuations promptly.
<br>Respiratory Support: Ensure optimal ventilatory settings, minimize suctioning trauma.
<br>Fluid Management: Accurately measure intake and output. Administer fluids and medications precisely.
<br>Head Circumference: Measure daily and plot on a growth chart to detect rapid increases indicative of hydrocephalus.
<br>Clustering Care: Organize care activities to minimize disturbances and allow for longer periods of uninterrupted rest.
<br>Pain Management: Assess for and manage pain/discomfort appropriately.
<br>Parental Support: Provide clear, compassionate communication about the infant's condition, prognosis, and potential long-term outcomes. Encourage bonding and involvement in care.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Any sudden change in neurological status, feeding, or vital signs in a preterm infant should raise immediate suspicion for PIVH or its complications.
<br><br>
<br>Explanation of PIVH: Explain what the bleed is, why it happened (fragile vessels, prematurity), and its potential implications using clear, simple language.
<br>Grading System: Explain the Papile grading (I-IV) and what each grade signifies in terms of severity and potential outcome.
<br>Prognosis: Be honest but hopeful. For Grade I/II, explain good prognosis. For Grade III/IV, discuss potential for hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and developmental delays, emphasizing that outcomes vary.
<br>Monitoring: Explain the need for frequent ultrasounds and other tests.
<br>Signs of Complications: Educate parents on signs of increasing head circumference, bulging fontanelle, vomiting, irritability, lethargy, or seizures, and when to seek immediate medical attention.
<br>Long-term Follow-up: Stress the importance of developmental follow-up programs (e.g., NICU follow-up clinic, early intervention services) to monitor and support neurodevelopment.
<br>Home Care: If discharged with a shunt, provide detailed instructions on shunt care and signs of malfunction or infection.
<br>Support Resources: Provide information on support groups or resources for parents of preterm infants or children with special needs.

 <br>
<br>Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) in newborns, most commonly refers to Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN).
<br>PPHN is a condition where the normal drop in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at birth fails to occur, or it increases after initially falling.
<br>This results in high blood pressure in the arteries supplying the lungs, leading to reduced blood flow to the lungs for oxygenation.
<br>Deoxygenated blood then bypasses the lungs via fetal shunts (foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus), leading to severe hypoxemia.
<br>It is a failure of the normal circulatory transition from fetal to extrauterine life.
<br><br>
<br>Failure of Normal Circulatory Transition: Pulmonary vessels remain constricted or become constricted after birth.
<br>Underlying Lung Diseases:

<br><a data-href="Meconium Aspiration Syndrome" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/OB/v. Newborn/Complications/Meconium Aspiration Syndrome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Meconium Aspiration Syndrome</a> (MAS) - most common cause.
<br><a data-href="Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Newborn" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/OB/v. Newborn/Complications/Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Newborn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Newborn</a> (RDS) - especially if severe.
<br>Pneumonia or Sepsis.
<br>Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) - leads to underdeveloped lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia).
<br>Pulmonary Hypoplasia (e.g., due to oligohydramnios).


<br>Maldevelopment of Pulmonary Vasculature: Abnormal structure or number of pulmonary vessels.
<br>Idiopathic PPHN: No clear underlying cause.
<br>In Utero Closure of Ductus Arteriosus.
<br><br>
<br>Perinatal Asphyxia: Lack of oxygen before, during, or after birth.
<br>Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS).
<br>Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS).
<br>Sepsis/Pneumonia.
<br>Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH).
<br>Maternal factors: Diabetes, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, maternal obesity, smoking, use of SSRIs or NSAIDs during late pregnancy.
<br>Delivery: Cesarean section (without labor), precipitous delivery.
<br>Fetal factors: Large for gestational age (LGA), small for gestational age (SGA), post-term gestation.
<br>Congenital Heart Defects: Such as transposition of the great arteries.
<br><br>
<br>Signs usually appear within the first 12-72 hours of life.
<br>Severe Hypoxemia: Low oxygen levels despite receiving 100% oxygen.
<br>Labile Oxygenation: Oxygen saturation fluctuates wildly.
<br>Respiratory Distress: Tachypnea (rapid breathing), retractions (subcostal, intercostal), nasal flaring, grunting.
<br>Cyanosis: Bluish discoloration of skin and mucous membranes, may be differential (pink upper body, cyanotic lower body) if ductus arteriosus is open with right-to-left shunt.
<br>Tachycardia.
<br>Hypotension.
<br>Heart Murmur: Due to shunting through patent ductus arteriosus or patent foramen ovale.
<br>Cool extremities.
<br>Poor perfusion.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Persistent hypoxemia despite maximal oxygen support is a hallmark of PPHN.
<br><br>
<br>Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE): Brain damage due to lack of oxygen.
<br>Multi-organ dysfunction: Kidney injury, liver dysfunction.
<br>Pulmonary Hemorrhage.
<br>Barotrauma/Volutrauma: Due to mechanical ventilation (e.g., pneumothorax).
<br>Hearing loss.
<br>Neurodevelopmental Impairment: Learning disabilities, developmental delays, cerebral palsy.
<br>Chronic Lung Disease (Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia).
<br>Death.
<br><br>
<br>Clinical Suspicion: Based on symptoms of respiratory distress and persistent hypoxemia.
<br>Hyperoxia Test: Administering 100% oxygen. If PaO2 remains low, suggests shunting (PPHN or cyanotic heart disease).
<br>Pre- and Post-Ductal Pulse Oximetry: Significant difference () suggests right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus.
<br>Echocardiogram (Cardiac Ultrasound): Definitive diagnosis. Visualizes heart structure, assesses pulmonary artery pressure, identifies shunting (ductus arteriosus, foramen ovale), and assesses right ventricular function.
<br>Chest X-ray: May show underlying lung disease (e.g., MAS, pneumonia) but often appears normal in primary PPHN.
<br>Arterial Blood Gas (ABG): Shows hypoxemia, often with respiratory or metabolic acidosis.
<br><br>
<br>Goal: Reduce PVR, improve oxygenation, support systemic blood pressure.
<br>Supportive Care:

<br>Optimal Thermoregulation: Maintain neutral thermal environment.
<br>Minimize Stimulation/Handling: Cluster care, sedation to reduce agitation and oxygen consumption.
<br>Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Strict monitoring.
<br>Nutrition: IV fluids or gavage feedings.


<br>Oxygen Therapy: Maintain adequate oxygenation.
<br>Mechanical Ventilation: Often required, carefully managed to avoid lung injury, optimize lung volume, and minimize PVR.
<br>Pharmacological Agents:

<br>Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO): First-line specific pulmonary vasodilator. Selectively relaxes pulmonary blood vessels without affecting systemic blood pressure.
<br>Sildenafil (Viagra/Revatio): Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, used orally or IV to relax pulmonary vessels.
<br>Milrinone: Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, improves cardiac contractility and causes pulmonary vasodilation.
<br>Prostaglandins (e.g., Iloprost): Pulmonary vasodilators.
<br>Vasopressors/Inotropes: (e.g., Dopamine, Dobutamine) to maintain systemic blood pressure and cardiac output, ensuring adequate perfusion and preventing shunting.


<br>Surfactant Therapy: If underlying RDS or MAS with surfactant deficiency.
<br>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO): Cardiopulmonary bypass used for severe, refractory PPHN when maximal conventional therapy fails.
<br><br>
<br>Continuous Monitoring: Intensive care setting. Continuous monitoring of HR, BP, RR, SpO2 (pre- and post-ductal). Arterial line for continuous BP and ABG sampling.
<br>Respiratory Management: Meticulous ventilator management. Avoid sudden changes in settings. Frequent assessment for air leaks (pneumothorax).
<br>Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Strict I&amp;O, monitor electrolytes, acid-base status.
<br>Medication Administration: Administer iNO (requires special equipment/monitoring), vasodilators, inotropes, and sedatives precisely. Monitor for desired effects and adverse reactions (e.g., hypotension with vasodilators).
<br>Minimize Stimulation: Create a quiet, dark environment. Cluster care, handle gently, avoid unnecessary procedures. Sedation often used.
<br>Thermoregulation: Maintain normothermia to minimize oxygen consumption.
<br>Neuroprotection: Monitor for signs of HIE.
<br>Parental Support: This is a critical illness. Provide consistent updates, answer questions honestly, facilitate bonding, and offer emotional support and resources.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Prioritize oxygenation and ventilation, followed by maintaining systemic blood pressure and reducing pulmonary vascular resistance. Recognize signs of deterioration quickly.
<br><br>
<br>Explanation of PPHN: Explain the condition simply – that the blood vessels in the lungs are too tight, making it hard for the baby to get enough oxygen.
<br>Causes and Risk Factors: Discuss why their baby might have developed PPHN (e.g., MAS, premature birth, C-section).
<br>Treatment Plan: Detail the various treatments (oxygen, ventilation, iNO, other medications), explaining their purpose and what to expect (e.g., baby will be on a breathing machine, may need special IVs).
<br>Critical Care: Explain the need for intensive monitoring and the equipment in the NICU.
<br>Prognosis and Complications: Be honest about the severity of the condition, potential for long-term complications (brain injury, hearing loss, developmental delays), but also offer hope and emphasize the importance of early intervention and follow-up.
<br>Parental Role: Explain how parents can help (e.g., minimizing stimulation, talking gently, touch).
<br>Long-term Follow-up: Stress the importance of developmental follow-up clinics, early intervention services, and hearing screenings for neurodevelopmental monitoring.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Reassure parents that PPHN is not their fault and provide them with clear, consistent information to reduce anxiety.

 <br>
<br>Benign, common, and transient yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera in newborns due to elevated unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin levels.
<br>Occurs in most newborns as part of normal physiological adaptation after birth.
<br>Typically appears after 24 hours of life, peaks at 3-5 days, and resolves within 1-2 weeks.
<br>NOTE: difference in <a data-href="Pathologic Jaundice in Newborns" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/OB/v. Newborn/Complications/Pathologic Jaundice in Newborns.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Pathologic Jaundice in Newborns</a> =&gt; appears WITHIN 24 hours<br><br>
<br>Increased Bilirubin Production:

<br>High red blood cell (RBC) volume in newborns.
<br>Shorter lifespan of fetal RBCs (approx. 70-90 days vs. 120 days in adults).
<br>Increased breakdown of RBCs (hemolysis) releasing bilirubin.


<br>Impaired Bilirubin Conjugation:

<br>Immature neonatal liver has lower levels and activity of UDP-glucuronyl transferase (UGT), the enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin.


<br>Increased Enterohepatic Circulation:

<br>Higher levels of beta-glucuronidase in the neonatal gut, which deconjugates bilirubin in the intestines.
<br>Slower gut motility and less frequent stools in newborns mean more unconjugated bilirubin is reabsorbed into circulation.


<br><br>
<br>Breastfeeding (Breastfeeding Jaundice/Breast Milk Jaundice):

<br>Breastfeeding Jaundice (Early-onset): Due to insufficient milk intake, leading to dehydration and increased enterohepatic circulation. Occurs in the first week.
<br>Breast Milk Jaundice (Late-onset): Due to substances in breast milk (e.g., glucuronidase) that interfere with bilirubin conjugation or increase enterohepatic circulation. Can last for several weeks or months.


<br>Prematurity (even late preterm, 34-36 weeks).
<br>East Asian ethnicity.
<br>Family history of physiologic jaundice.
<br>Maternal diabetes.
<br>Male gender.
<br>Polycythemia.
<br>History of cephalohematoma or significant bruising.
<br><br>
<br>Yellowing of skin and sclera: Typically visible when total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels reach .
<br>Appears after 24 hours of life.
<br>Progression is usually cephalocaudal (starts on face, progresses to trunk and extremities).
<br>Jaundice typically resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks in term infants.
<br>Infant usually appears otherwise healthy, feeding well, and active.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Differentiating between physiologic and pathologic jaundice is crucial. Remember: physiologic jaundice never appears in the first 24 hours of life.
<br><br>
<br>Generally no complications as it's a benign process.
<br>Untreated severe hyperbilirubinemia (even if initially physiologic) can become pathologic and lead to:

<br>Acute bilirubin encephalopathy.
<br>Kernicterus (chronic bilirubin encephalopathy) - permanent neurological damage. This happens when bilirubin levels are excessively high and toxic to the brain.


<br><br>
<br>Clinical assessment: Visual inspection (blanch skin to check for yellowing), typically done every 8-12 hours in the first few days.
<br>Transcutaneous Bilirubin (TcB) measurement: Non-invasive device used for screening. If TcB is high, a TSB (Total Serum Bilirubin) blood test is performed.
<br>Total Serum Bilirubin (TSB) measurement: Blood test is the gold standard.

<br>Levels are plotted on a nomogram based on the infant's age in hours to assess risk for hyperbilirubinemia.


<br>Assessment of feeding and hydration.
<br>Rule out pathologic causes: If jaundice is severe, early onset, or persists, further investigation is needed (e.g., direct Coombs test, blood type, CBC, direct bilirubin).
<br><br>
<br>No specific treatment often required: Many infants with physiologic jaundice do not need intervention beyond monitoring.
<br>Frequent and effective feedings:

<br>Breastfed infants: Nurse  times in 24 hours to promote bilirubin excretion through stools and ensure adequate hydration. Avoid water or dextrose water supplementation.
<br>Formula-fed infants: Ensure adequate intake.


<br>Phototherapy: If TSB levels cross specific thresholds on the nomogram for the infant's age and risk factors.

<br>Blue-green light converts unconjugated bilirubin into water-soluble isomers for excretion.


<br>Discontinuation of breastfeeding (temporarily): Rarely indicated for breast milk jaundice if bilirubin levels are dangerously high and other measures fail. Mother can pump to maintain supply.
<br><br>
<br>Assessment:

<br>Visual assessment for jaundice: Check skin color (blanching on forehead/nose), sclera. Note progression.
<br>Feeding assessment: Observe latch, suck, swallow, and number of wet diapers/stools. Promote effective feeding.
<br>Hydration status: Assess fontanelles, skin turgor, mucous membranes.
<br>Vital signs: Especially temperature (phototherapy can cause hyperthermia).


<br>Monitoring:

<br>Bilirubin levels: Track TcB/TSB results and plot on nomogram.
<br>Weight: Monitor for excessive weight loss.
<br>Output: Document number of wet diapers and stools.


<br>Patient Education:

<br>Explain physiologic jaundice as a normal process.
<br>Teach parents how to assess for jaundice and when to seek medical attention.
<br>Emphasize the importance of frequent feedings and adequate hydration.


<br>Phototherapy Care (if needed):

<br>Maximize skin exposure (diaper only).
<br>Apply eye patches.
<br>Monitor temperature closely.
<br>Ensure adequate fluid intake.
<br>Promote parent-infant bonding during breaks.


<br>NCLEX Tip: Focus on education and supportive measures. Early and effective feeding is key in preventing severe physiologic jaundice.
<br><br>
<br>Normal vs. concerning jaundice: Explain that mild yellowing after 24 hours is common and usually resolves, but explain signs that warrant concern.
<br>Monitoring at home: Teach parents how to check for jaundice (blanching skin) and how far it has progressed.
<br>Feeding is key: Emphasize the importance of frequent (8-12 times/day) and effective feedings to help baby pass bilirubin in stools.
<br>Warning signs to call the provider:

<br>Jaundice appears within the first 24 hours of life.
<br>Jaundice spreads rapidly or appears very deep yellow/orange.
<br>Baby is difficult to wake, not feeding well, excessively sleepy, irritable, has a high-pitched cry.
<br>Fewer wet diapers or stools than expected.
<br>Fever.


<br>No home remedies: Advise against using using sunlight or other unproven methods for treating jaundice, as they are ineffective and potentially harmful.
<br>Follow-up: Stress the importance of all scheduled bilirubin checks and well-baby visits.

 <br>
<br>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also called hyaline membrane disease
<br>Common cause of respiratory distress in preterm newborns
<br>Due to insufficient surfactant production leading to alveolar collapse
<br><br>
<br>Prematurity (before 34 weeks) → immature lungs, low surfactant
<br>Maternal diabetes → delayed surfactant synthesis
<br>Perinatal asphyxia → surfactant inactivation
<br><br>
<br>Prematurity (most significant)
<br>Maternal diabetes mellitus
<br>Cesarean delivery without labor
<br>Male infants
<br>Second-born twin
<br><br>
<br>Tachypnea (&gt;60 breaths/min)
<br>Nasal flaring, grunting, intercostal/substernal retractions
<br>Cyanosis, decreased breath sounds
<br>Hypoxia and respiratory acidosis
<br>Ground-glass appearance on chest x-ray
<br><br>
<br>Hypoxia → organ damage
<br>Pneumothorax (air leak)
<br>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) with prolonged oxygen use
<br>Intraventricular hemorrhage
<br><br>
<br>Chest x-ray: ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms
<br>Blood gases: hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis
<br>Clinical signs + risk factors
<br><br>
<br>Antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone) to promote surfactant production if preterm delivery expected
<br>Exogenous surfactant administration via ET tube after birth
<br>Oxygen therapy (careful to avoid oxygen toxicity)
<br>CPAP or mechanical ventilation as needed
<br>Maintain neutral thermal environment
<br><br>
<br>Monitor respiratory rate, effort, and oxygen saturation
<br>Provide supplemental oxygen, titrate to avoid hyperoxia
<br>Maintain warmth and minimize handling
<br>Educate parents about prematurity and RDS treatment
<br>Monitor for signs of complications (pneumothorax, BPD)
<br>Administer medications as ordered (surfactant, corticosteroids)
<br>Encourage kangaroo care if stable
<br>Mnemonic for RDS risk factors: "Premature Males Can Die"<br>
<br>Prematurity, Male, Cesarean, Diabetes
<br>NCLEX Tip: RDS is due to surfactant deficiency; exogenous surfactant and respiratory support are key interventions.]]></description><link>https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/OB/v.

 <br><br>
<br>Self-limiting respiratory condition in newborns characterized by rapid breathing shortly after birth.
<br>Caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid.
<br>Also known as "wet lung" or "Type II RDS."
<br><br>
<br>Delayed Clearance of Fetal Lung Fluid: During vaginal birth, the thoracic squeeze helps expel fluid from the lungs. In TTN, this mechanism is impaired or incomplete.
<br>Commonly seen in:

<br>C-section births (especially elective, without labor).
<br>Rapid vaginal births.
<br>Infants of diabetic mothers.
<br>Late preterm infants (34-36 weeks gestation).


<br><br>
<br>Cesarean section delivery (especially without labor onset).
<br>Preterm or late preterm birth (34-36 weeks gestation).
<br>Macrosomia (large-for-gestational-age infant).
<br>Maternal diabetes.
<br>Male gender.
<br>Perinatal asphyxia.
<br>Maternal asthma.
<br><br>
<br>Tachypnea: Respiratory rate often  breaths/minute (can be  breaths/minute).
<br>Retractions: Subcostal, intercostal, or xiphoid retractions.
<br>Nasal flaring.
<br>Grunting: Audible expiratory grunt.
<br>Cyanosis: Mild perioral or circumoral cyanosis, or central cyanosis (if severe).
<br>Increased anteroposterior diameter of the chest.
<br>Symptoms usually appear within the first few hours of birth and resolve within 24-72 hours.
<br><br>
<br>Generally benign and self-limiting.
<br>Rarely, severe cases may lead to:

<br>Pulmonary hypertension (due to persistent high pulmonary vascular resistance).
<br>Pneumothorax (rare).
<br>Aspiration (if fed orally while tachypneic).
<br>Hypoxia requiring prolonged respiratory support.


<br><br>
<br>Clinical presentation: Based on the characteristic signs of respiratory distress appearing shortly after birth and rapid improvement.
<br>Chest X-ray:

<br>Classic findings: Prominent perihilar streaking, fluid in the fissures, hyperexpansion, flattened diaphragms, possible cardiomegaly.
<br>Differs from RDS (Hyaline Membrane Disease) which shows diffuse ground-glass appearance and air bronchograms.


<br>Blood gas: May show mild hypoxemia.
<br>Rule out other causes: Important to differentiate from more serious conditions like sepsis, pneumonia, or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
<br><br>
<br>Supportive Care:

<br>Oxygen therapy: Humidified oxygen via nasal cannula or oxygen hood to maintain SpO2 .
<br>Nasal CPAP: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) may be used for persistent hypoxemia or significant retractions.
<br>Thermoregulation: Maintain neutral thermal environment to minimize oxygen consumption.
<br>Nutritional support: IV fluids until respiratory status improves enough for oral feedings to prevent aspiration. Gavage feedings may be used.


<br>Monitoring: Continuous pulse oximetry, respiratory rate and effort.
<br>Antibiotics: May be initiated empirically if sepsis cannot be immediately ruled out, especially if risk factors for infection are present. Discontinued if cultures are negative.
<br><br>
<br>Respiratory Assessment: Frequent and thorough assessment of respiratory rate, effort, presence of retractions, grunting, nasal flaring, and cyanosis.
<br>Oxygen Administration: Ensure proper setup and monitoring of oxygen delivery.
<br>Thermoregulation: Keep infant warm to prevent cold stress, which increases oxygen demand.
<br>Hydration/Nutrition: Administer IV fluids as prescribed. Withhold oral feedings if respiratory rate is high () to prevent aspiration; initiate gavage feedings.
<br>Positioning: Head of bed slightly elevated, or "sniffing" position to optimize airway.
<br>Parental Support: Explain the condition to parents, reassuring them it is usually temporary and self-limiting. Educate on signs of worsening distress.
<br>Differentiation: Be vigilant for signs that might indicate a more serious underlying condition.
<br>NCLEX Tip: Remember "Too Tired to Nourish": Infants with TTN are often too tachypneic to safely breastfeed or bottle-feed, necessitating gavage feeding or IV fluids.
<br><br>
<br>Nature of TTN: Explain that it's a temporary condition due to "wet lungs" that usually resolves quickly.
<br>Symptoms: Describe the symptoms observed (fast breathing, grunting) and why the baby needs monitoring.
<br>Treatment: Explain the purpose of oxygen, IV fluids, and temporary feeding tubes (if used).
<br>Monitoring: Inform parents about the continuous monitoring of breathing and oxygen levels.
<br>Reassurance: Emphasize that most babies recover fully without long-term problems.
<br>Expected Course: Explain that symptoms typically improve within 24-72 hours.
<br>When to Call: Educate parents on signs of respiratory distress to watch for after discharge.

<br>Phase 1: Tension Building – Victim walks on eggshells, internalizes blame to prevent violence.<br>

<br>Phase 2: Physically Abusive Phase – Violence erupts; victim minimizes harm and avoids care.<br>

<br>Phase 3: Honeymoon – Abuser apologizes; victim clings to hope and feels responsible.
<br>Phases of Rape Victims<br>
<br>Acute phase (disorganization) – Overwhelmed by shock, fear, and intense emotional distress.<br>

<br>Acetaminophen
<br>NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin) (see also <a data-href="Antipyretic and Anti-Inflammatory" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Pharmacology/Analgesia/Antipyretic and Anti-Inflammatory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Antipyretic and Anti-Inflammatory</a>)
<br>Mechanism of Action (MOI):<br>
<br>Acetaminophen: Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the brain, reducing pain and fever.
<br>NSAIDs: Inhibit COX enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), blocking the formation of prostaglandins, reducing inflammation, pain, and fever.
<br>Indications:<br>
<br>Mild to moderate pain (headache, muscle pain, arthritis)
<br>Fever reduction
<br>Inflammatory pain (NSAIDs)
<br>Contraindications:<br>
<br>Acetaminophen: Liver disease, alcohol use, or overdose risk (liver toxicity).
<br>NSAIDs: History of GI ulcers, kidney disease, or bleeding disorders.
<br>Nursing Considerations:<br>
<br>Monitor liver function (acetaminophen) and renal function (NSAIDs).
<br>Educate on avoiding alcohol with acetaminophen to prevent liver damage.
<br>NSAIDs may cause GI upset, ulcers, or bleeding; recommend taking with food.
<br><br><br>Prototype Drugs:<br>
<br>Morphine
<br>Hydrocodone
<br>Oxycodone
<br>Fentanyl (patch, IV)
<br>Mechanism of Action (MOI):<br>

<br>NSAIDS

<br>First line of drugs for mild-moderate inflammation
<br>inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins
<br>Ibuprofen

<br>Mechanism

<br>treatment of mild to moderate pain, fever, and inflammation.
<br>efficacy is equivalent to that of aspirin and other NSAIDs
<br>Due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis
<br>indications include pain associated with chronic musculoskeletal disorders, such as RA and osteoarthritis, headache, dental pain, and dysmenorrhea.


<br>Administration Alerts

<br>Give on empty stomach
<br>Asthma or allergies may have hypersensitivity
<br>Caution: pregnancy. NSAID increases pregnancy risk.
<br>DO NOT USE IN LATE PREGNANCY! (may prematurely close fetal ductus arteriosus)


<br>Adverse Effects

<br>nausea, heartburn, epigastric pain, and dizziness
<br>Serious: GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines
<br>may cause an increased risk of thrombotic events, MI, and stroke, which can be fatal


<br>Contraindications

<br>for the treatment of perioperative pain in those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery
<br>CKD or hepatic impairment






<br>Corticosteroids - should only be used for 1-3 weeks, then switch to NSAID

<br>Prednisone

<br>Class - anti-inflammatory, corticosteroid
<br>Actions and Uses

<br>allergic and inflammatory disorders
<br>metabolized to an active form, which is also available as a drug called prednisolone
<br>When used for inflammation, duration of therapy is commonly limited to 4 to 10 days.
<br>For long-term therapy, alternate-day dosing is often used, and the dosage is gradually lowered.
<br>occasionally used to terminate acute bronchospasm in patients with asthma and as an antineoplastic drug for patients with certain cancers, such as Hodgkin’s disease, acute leukemia, and lymphomas.
<br>Available in tablet and oral solution forms.


<br>Administration Alerts

<br>Administer with food and do not chew or divide tablets.
<br>Do not use it if signs of a systemic infection are present.
<br>When using the drug for more than 10 days, the dose must be slowly tapered.
<br>May cause fetal harm
<br>Do not use if breastfeeding
<br>Do not stop abruptly! Taper of if used longer than 1-2 weeks
<br>Adrenal insufficiency and crisis may occur with profound hypotension, tachycardia, and other adverse effects if the drug is stopped abruptly.


<br>Adverse Effects

<br>few serious adverse effects.
<br>Long-term therapy may result in Cushing syndrome, a condition that includes hyperglycemia, fat redistribution to the shoulders and face, muscle weakness, bruising, and bones that easily fracture.
<br>Because gastric ulcers may occur with long-term therapy, an antiulcer medication may be prescribed prophylactically. Use with caution in patients with peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, or diverticulitis. Mood changes, increased appetite, and weight gain may occur.


<br>Contraindications:

<br>Patients with serious viral, bacterial, fungal, or protozoan infections should not take prednisone.






<br>Antipyretics<br>
<br>Acetaminophen

<br>Class - antipyretic, analgesic, para-aminophenol derivative
<br>Actions and Uses

<br>Reduces fever by direct action at the level of the hypothalamus and dilation of peripheral blood vessels, which enables sweating and dissipation of heat.
<br>has no anti-inflammatory properties; therefore, it is not effective in treating arthritis or pain caused by tissue swelling following injury.
<br>The primary therapeutic is for the treatment of fever in children and for relief of mild to moderate pain when aspirin is contraindicated.
<br>may be combined with opioids - for synergistic dosing
<br>Acetaminophen has no effect on platelet aggregation and does not exhibit cardiotoxicity.
<br>Does not cause GI bleeding or ulcers or cause Reye syndrome in children (unlike NSAIDs)


<br>Administration Alert

<br>Never administer to patients who consume alcohol regularly due to the potential for drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
<br>extreme care must be taken to not duplicate doses by taking several products concurrently
<br>safe for pregnant


<br>Adverse

<br>generally safe, and adverse effects are uncommon at therapeutic doses.
<br>Excessive acetaminophen use, especially when combined with alcohol use, is the number one cause of acute liver failure in the United States.
<br>Chronic ingestion results in neutropenia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and CKD.
<br>Stevens–Johnson syndrome


<br>Contraindications

<br>Hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or phenacetin and chronic alcohol consumption.

<br>Anticoags from NurseintheMaking<br>
<br>Anticoagulants

<br>prevent new clots from forming, prevent current clots from getting bigger; not blood thinners!
<br>Uses: DVT, PE, A-Fib, post-op patients
<br>Heparin (LMWH - Low Molecular Weight Heparin: Lovenox - generic enoxaparin)

<br>IV or SQ
<br>Rapid onset, Heparins Happens Fast - great for short term therapy
<br>Monitor:

<br>aPTT (heparin has “P” in it) - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time - how fast blood clots
<br>“If numbers are high, the patient will die”, if low - clots will grow - must be therapeutic range
<br>Antidote: Protamine Sulfate


<br>Educate: subq 2” from umbilicus, 90deg, do not massage site, bruising/pain is common


<br>Warfarin (Coumadin)

<br>Commonly PO
<br>Slow - hours-day / “Warfarin you have to Wait”
<br>Can be given with Heparin together
<br>Monitor:

<br>INR - International Normalized Ratio - how fast blood clots
<br>“If numbers are high, the patient will die”, if low - clots will grow - must be therapeutic range
<br>Antidote: Vitamin K (during War, Vitamin K KILLS Warfarin!)


<br>Educate:

<br>Be consistent with Vit K intake - green leafy, liver






<br>Know the Difference!<br>
Anticoagulants - interfere with the body's clotting factors (proteins) in the coagulation cascade to prevent clot formation<br>
Uses: prevention of venous thromboembolisms (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke, afib<br>
Antiplatelets - inhibit platelet aggregation (clumping) to prevent the formation of clots in arteries<br>
Uses: prevent heart attacks strokes, and other cardiovascular events related to atherosclerosis<br>Hemostasis - delicate balance regulated by substances in blood: procoagulants vs anticoagulants<br>
<br>Thromboembolic Disorder - too much clotting (leads to thrombi or emboli)
<br>Coagulation Disorder - too little clotting, leads to excessive bleeding

<br>Thrombocytopenia - decreased platelet production or super platelet destruction 


<br>Labs to diagnose bleeding disorder:<br>
prothrombin time (PT)<br>
thrombin time<br>
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)<br>
in some instances, a bleeding time.<br>Prefilled Subcutaneous Injection - Enoxaparin<br>
<br>do not expel air bubbles - they make sure that full dose is given
<br>inject med into anterolateral abdominal wall
<br>DO NOT MASSAGE site after injection =&gt; can cause bruising &amp; tissue damage with anticoagulants

<br><br>
<br>Prevent platelet aggregation to reduce clot formation
<br>Used for stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) prevention, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and after stent placement
<br>Do not dissolve existing clots but prevent new ones from forming
<br><br>
<br>Inhibit platelet activation and aggregation by blocking specific pathways
<br>Common targets: thromboxane A₂, ADP receptors, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors
<br><br>
<br>Aspirin – Irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, reducing thromboxane A₂ production
<br>Clopidogrel (Plavix) – Blocks P2Y₁₂ ADP receptors on platelets, preventing aggregation
<br>Ticagrelor (Brilinta) – Reversible P2Y₁₂ ADP receptor blocker, faster onset than clopidogrel
<br>Abciximab, Eptifibatide, Tirofiban – Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, used in acute coronary syndromes
<br><br>
<br>Bleeding (GI bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage)
<br>Bruising, easy bleeding (nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from cuts)
<br>Gastrointestinal irritation, ulcers (aspirin)
<br>Thrombocytopenia (rare but serious)
<br><br>
<br>Active bleeding disorders (e.g., GI ulcers, hemorrhagic stroke)
<br>Severe liver disease
<br>Aspirin allergy (especially in asthma patients)
<br>Recent surgery (risk of excessive bleeding)
<br>Pregnancy (some agents contraindicated, especially in the third trimester)
<br><br>
<br>Monitor for signs of bleeding (bruising, black stools, hematuria)
<br>Educate on avoiding NSAIDs and alcohol (increases bleeding risk)
<br>Assess platelet count and coagulation labs if prolonged therapy
<br>Encourage adherence, especially post-stroke or post-MI
<br>Advise patients to inform healthcare providers before surgery or dental procedures

 <br>MCTOM<br>
Methergine<br>
Carboprost Tromethamine<br>
TXA<br>
Oxytocin<br>
Misoprostol<br><br>
<br>Indications: Prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) caused by uterine atony or subinvolution.
<br>Mechanism of Action: Directly stimulates smooth muscle of the uterus, causing rapid, sustained tetanic uterine contraction; also constricts peripheral and coronary blood vessels.
<br>Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to methergine, hypertension (pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, chronic hypertension), cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease, hepatic or renal impairment, sepsis, threatened spontaneous abortion (before delivery of placenta), induction of labor.
<br>Expected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/cramping, dizziness, headache, diaphoresis.
<br>Adverse Effects: Severe hypertension (potentially leading to cerebral hemorrhage), seizures, palpitations, chest pain, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, stroke, allergic reactions (rash, anaphylaxis), ergotism (rare, with prolonged use or overdose: peripheral vasospasm, cyanosis, cold extremities).
<br>Nursing Considerations: Assess blood pressure frequently (every 15 minutes or more often as indicated) during administration and for several hours afterward; monitor uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and fundal height; administer IV slowly over at least 60 seconds (rapid IV push can cause severe hypertension and cerebrovascular accident); monitor for signs of ergotism; educate patient about potential side effects and to report any severe headache, chest pain, or vision changes; typically given IM; IV is reserved for emergent situations due to risk of severe hypertension.
<br>Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: 140/90 BP or greater; signs of severe hypertension or neurological symptoms (e.g., severe headache, visual disturbances, seizures); chest pain or signs of myocardial ischemia.
<br><br>
<br>Indications: Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony that is unresponsive to other oxytocic agents; used in pregnancy termination.
<br>Mechanism of Action: Potent prostaglandin F2-alpha analog; directly stimulates sustained contraction of uterine smooth muscle; also causes contraction of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle.
<br>Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to carboprost or prostaglandins, acute pelvic inflammatory disease, active cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease, asthma (absolute contraindication due to bronchoconstriction); caution with hypertension, hypotension, anemia, jaundice, diabetes, epilepsy, previous uterine surgery (e.g., C-section).
<br>Expected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (very common due to smooth muscle stimulation), fever, chills, flushing, headache, tachycardia.
<br>Adverse Effects: Bronchospasm, wheezing, dyspnea, hypertension or hypotension, pulmonary edema, <a data-href="Uterine Rupture" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/OB/iii. Labor/Complications/Uterine Rupture.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Uterine Rupture</a> (rare, especially with overuse or in grand multiparas), uterine hypertonus, tetanic contractions, arrhythmias, <a data-href="DIC" href="https://rpb-rn.github.io/nu-bsn/Med-Surg/Hematological/DIC.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DIC</a> (disseminated intravascular coagulation, rare).
<br>Nursing Considerations: Administer deep IM only; avoid IV administration; rotate injection sites if multiple doses are needed; monitor uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and vital signs (BP, pulse, respirations, temperature) frequently; have antiemetics and antidiarrheals readily available and consider pre-medication; auscultate lung sounds for signs of bronchospasm; assess for fever, which is a common but usually transient side effect; educate patient about common GI side effects.
<br>Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Severe bronchospasm or respiratory distress; sustained severe hypertension or hypotension refractory to treatment; signs of uterine rupture.
<br><br>
<br>Indications: Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage when conservative management is insufficient; reduces blood loss in various surgical procedures and trauma.
<br>Mechanism of Action: Antifibrinolytic agent; reversibly binds to plasminogen and plasmin, preventing fibrinolysis (breakdown of blood clots); stabilizes existing clots.
<br>Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to TXA, active intravascular clotting (e.g., DIC, unless primary fibrinolysis is predominant), history of thrombosis (DVT, PE, stroke, MI), unless benefits clearly outweigh risks, severe renal impairment (dose adjustment needed), history of seizures (may increase seizure risk), color vision impairment (can mask retinal toxicity).
<br>Expected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, hypotension (if administered too rapidly IV), abdominal pain.
<br>Adverse Effects: Thromboembolic events (DVT, PE, stroke, MI) – although studies suggest low risk in PPH; seizures (especially with rapid IV administration or high doses); visual disturbances, impaired color vision; allergic reactions; renal cortical necrosis (rare, with prolonged use/high doses).
<br>Nursing Considerations: Administer intravenously slowly over 10 minutes to prevent hypotension; monitor for signs of thrombosis (e.g., leg pain, swelling, chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological changes); assess for any changes in vision or color perception; monitor vital signs, uterine tone, and blood loss; ensure proper hydration; typically given within 3 hours of birth for PPH benefit.
<br>Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Signs of active thrombosis (e.g., new onset chest pain, dyspnea, calf pain, neurological deficits); severe allergic reaction; new onset or worsening seizures; significant visual changes.
<br><br>
<br>Indications: Prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony; induction and augmentation of labor; to promote milk let-down (nasal spray, rare).
<br>Mechanism of Action: Synthetic polypeptide hormone structurally identical to natural oxytocin; acts on oxytocin receptors in the uterus, causing rhythmic contractions of uterine smooth muscle; increases the frequency and intensity of contractions; also has antidiuretic effects at high doses.
<br>Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to oxytocin, cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), unfavorable fetal position or presentation, significant placenta previa or vasa previa, umbilical cord prolapse, uterine hypertonicity or fetal distress when delivery is not imminent, severe toxemia, active genital herpes, undelivered placenta (before delivery of placenta in PPH management, it's typically given after delivery).
<br>Expected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/cramping, headache, flushing.
<br>Adverse Effects: Maternal: Uterine hyperstimulation/tetany (leading to uterine rupture, placental abruption, fetal distress), water intoxication (hyponatremia, cerebral edema, seizures, coma) with high doses and large volumes of hypotonic fluids, hypotension or hypertension (less common), arrhythmias, postpartum hemorrhage (paradoxical, if receptors are saturated or overstimulated), allergic reactions; Fetal: Fetal distress (due to uterine hyperstimulation), bradycardia, hypoxia, acidosis.
<br>Nursing Considerations: Administer as a dilute IV infusion via a pump, typically as a piggyback into a main IV line; never administer undiluted IV push in PPH management (can cause severe hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias); monitor uterine activity (frequency, duration, intensity of contractions), uterine resting tone, and vaginal bleeding; monitor vital signs (BP, pulse) frequently; assess intake and output to monitor for water intoxication; assess for signs of uterine hyperstimulation (contractions lasting &gt;90 seconds, less than 2 minutes apart, or resting tone &gt;20 mmHg); have tocolytics (e.g., terbutaline) available to relax the uterus in case of hyperstimulation.
<br>Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Signs of uterine hyperstimulation (contractions too frequent, too long, or resting tone too high); signs of fetal distress (if used antepartum); signs of water intoxication (e.g., hyponatremia, decreased urine output, confusion, seizures); significant maternal hypotension or arrhythmia.
<br><br>
<br>Indications: Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony; cervical ripening and labor induction; abortion (medical); prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers.
<br>Mechanism of Action: Synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog; causes strong uterine contractions; also causes cervical softening and dilation.
<br>Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to misoprostol or other prostaglandins, known allergy to other prostaglandins; in the context of PPH, generally few absolute contraindications once the baby and placenta are delivered, as it's a critical situation; however, caution in patients with glaucoma, asthma (less of a concern than carboprost but still a prostaglandin), or severe cardiovascular disease; active gastrointestinal disease (if given orally for ulcer prevention).
<br>Expected Side Effects: Shivering, chills, fever (very common), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (common), abdominal pain/cramping, headache.
<br>Adverse Effects: Uterine hyperstimulation/tetany (leading to uterine rupture, especially with high doses or in cases of previous uterine surgery), hypotension or hypertension, bradycardia or tachycardia, allergic reactions, bronchospasm (less common than with carboprost), DIC (rare).
<br>Nursing Considerations: Can be administered orally, sublingually, rectally, or vaginally for PPH; rectal administration is often preferred in emergent PPH due to rapid absorption and less GI side effects; monitor uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature) frequently; anticipate and manage shivering/chills with warm blankets; provide comfort measures for nausea and vomiting; educate patient about common side effects; ensure accurate dosage and route of administration.
<br>Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Sustained uterine hypertonus not responding to other measures; signs of uterine rupture; severe allergic reaction.

 <br><br>
<br>Indication: Medical abortion, cervical ripening, postpartum hemorrhage
<br>Mechanism: Prostaglandin E1 analog — stimulates uterine contractions and cervical softening
<br>Nursing Implications:

<br>Monitor for uterine cramping and bleeding
<br>Assess for complete expulsion in medical abortion
<br>Educate on expected side effects (e.g., chills, fever, diarrhea, N/V, dyspepsia)
<br>Monitor for signs and symptoms of shock, such as tachycardia, hypotension, and anxiety.


<br><br>
<br>Indication: Medical abortion (often combined with misoprostol)
<br>Mechanism: Progesterone receptor antagonist — blocks progesterone, leading to decidual breakdown and detachment of pregnancy
<br>Nursing Implications:

<br>Monitor for headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and heavy bleeding.
<br>Anticipate administration of antiemetic prior to use to reduce nausea and vomiting.
<br>Encourage client to use acetaminophen to reduce discomfort from cramping.


<br><br>
<br>Indication: Cervical ripening and labor induction
<br>Mechanism: Prostaglandin E2 analog — promotes cervical softening and stimulates uterine contractions
<br>Administration: gel form, warm it first, sterile technique, lie supine for 30 minutes
<br>Nursing Implications:

<br>Monitor fetal heart rate and uterine activity continuously
<br>Remove insert if uterine tachysystole occurs
<br>Educate on potential side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
<br>Sterile technique, supine position for 30 minutes after admin


<br><br>
<br>Indication: Prevention of Rh alloimmunization in Rh-negative mothers
<br>Mechanism: Passive immunization — binds Rh-positive fetal cells in maternal circulation to prevent immune response
<br>Nursing Implications:

<br>Confirm mother’s Rh-negative status and absence of sensitization
<br>Administer at 28 weeks and within 72 hours postpartum (or after procedures like amniocentesis)
<br>Educate mother on purpose and timing of administration

<br>Local Anesthetics - loss of sensation to a relatively small part of the body for a brief medical or dental procedure.

<br>Esters

<br>Benzocaine, Procaine  (Novocain)
<br>Adverse: CNS depression, burning, stinging, redness


<br>Amidies

<br>Articaine, lidocaine
<br>Adverse: burning, stinging, redness at site




<br>General Anesthetics

<br>IV

<br>Propofol (Diprivan)

<br>MOA - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist
<br>Primary Actions

<br>Most widely used IV anesthetics due to efficacy and safety profile
<br>indicated for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia
<br>immediate onset of action and is used effectively for conscious sedation
<br>Emergence is rapid and few adverse effects occur during recovery. 
<br>Has an antiemetic effect that can prevent nausea and vomiting.


<br>Alerts

<br>faster onset and deeper sedation compared to benzo
<br>not showed evidence of fetal harm
<br>Adverse effects on breastmilk =&gt; neonate


<br>Adverse

<br>Pain, apnea, resp depression, hypOtension
<br>collection of metabolic abnormalities and organ system failures, aka, propofol infusion syndrome (PIF)
<br>severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, lipidemia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, and cardiac failure.




<br>Inhaled

<br>Therapeutic Gasses

<br>Nitrous Oxide

<br>Primary Actions

<br>analgesia caused by suppression of pain mechanisms in the CNS
<br>low potency and does not produce complete loss of consciousness or profound relaxation of skeletal muscle
<br>commonly combined with other surgical anesthetic agents. 
<br>Ideal for short surgical or dental procedures because the patient remains conscious and can follow instructions while experiencing full analgesia.
<br>always combined with oxygen (25 to 30%) and is administered in a semi closed method through a tube or by mask.


<br>Alerts

<br>Does NOT cause fetal harm
<br>Adverse
<br>Few adverse in low dose
<br>At higher doses, stage 2 anesthesia such as anxiety, excitement, and combativeness
<br>Lower dose will reverse
<br>difficulty breathing or experience nausea and vomiting following the procedure


<br>Contra

<br>impaired consciousness, head injury, non-compliance, decompression sickness, nitrogen narcosis, air embolism, undiagnosed abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, hypotension, shock, COPD, cyanosis, pneumothorax, or air transport.
<br>Use nitrous oxide cautiously in myasthenia gravis due to respiratory depression and prolonged effects. Monitor cardiovascular patients, especially with elevated ICP, for prolonged or potentiated hypnotic effects

<br>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which antibodies destroy the communication between nerves and muscle, resulting in weakness of the skeletal muscles. Myasthenia gravis affects the voluntary muscles of the body, especially those that control the eyes, mouth, throat and limbs.












<br>Volatile Liquids

<br>Isoflurane (Forane)

<br>MOA - produces a potent level of surgical anesthesia that is rapid in onset
<br>Primary Actions

<br>Provides smooth induction with a low degree of metabolism by the body
<br>excellent muscle relaxation and may be used off-label as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of status asthmaticus
<br>Isoflurane with oxygen or with an oxygen and nitrous oxide mixture may be used
<br>does not sensitize the myocardium for dysrhythmias, and it produces fewer cardiovascular effects than other general anesthetics.


<br>Alerts

<br>Do not use in pregnant


<br>Adverse

<br>Mild nausea, vomiting, and tremor
<br>dose-dependent respiratory depression and a reduction in blood pressure.
<br>Malignant hyperthermia with elevated temperature has been reported.


<br>Contraindications

<br>Do not use for patients with genetic predisposition to malignant hyperthermia
<br>Caution: patients with head trauma or brain neoplasms due to possible increases in intracranial pressure








<br>Adjuncts to Anesthesia<br>
Neuromuscular Blockers<br>
Succinylcholine (Anectine, Quelicine)<br>
Class<br>
Skeletal muscle paralytic drug; neuromuscular blocker<br>
Depolarizing blocker; acetylcholine receptor blocking drug<br>
Actions<br>
Like acetylcholine, succinylcholine acts on cholinergic receptor sites at neuromuscular junctions<br>
Effects are first noted as muscle weakness and muscle spasms, eventually, paralysis<br>

<br>Triptans -  work by constricting intracranial vessels
<br>Ergot Alkaloids
<br>Algorithm for treating migraine:<br>
<br>Mild migraine - acetaminophen or NSAID. If ineffective, move to:
<br>Triptans

<br>Usually in oral form (may cause N/V), alternative forms are available
<br>Intranasal or prefilled syringes also available
<br>All triptans have similar effectiveness and side effects
<br>If ineffective, move to:


<br>Ergot Alkaloids

<br>Ergotamine - inexpensive, available in oral, SL, suppository
<br>Dihydroergotamine - nasal spray
<br>Interact with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors and serotonergic receptors =&gt; many side effects.
<br>Some E.A can cause fetal harm and should not be used by women who may become pregnant!


<br>Migraine Prophylaxis<br>
<br>Antiseizures - gabapentin, topiramate, valproic acid
<br>Beta-adrenergic blockers - atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol
<br>Calcium channel blockers - nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil
<br>Tricyclic antidepressants - amitriptyline, imipramine, protriptyline
<br>Misc - riboflavin

BAM-SLM<br><br><br>Prototype: Albuterol<br>
Actions: activate the sympathetic nervous system, which relaxes bronchial smooth muscle<br>
SABA that is used to relieve the bronchospasm of asthma<br>
rapid onset and excellent safety profile = first-line drug for the termination of acute bronchospasm<br>
facilitates mucus drainage and can inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals from mast cells.<br>
When inhaled 15 to 30 ­minutes prior to physical activity, it can prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.<br>
not recommended for asthma prophylaxis.<br>Administration Alerts: use only the actuator that comes with the canister. Observe and instruct the patient in proper use.<br>
teratogenic in laboratory animals; however, human studies have not found increased birth defects or miscarriages. Effects on the breastfed neonate are not known.<br>Adverse Effects: palpitations, headaches, throat irritation, tremor, nervousness, restlessness, and tachycardia<br>
Less common: dry mouth, insomnia, chest pain, allergic rxn<br>Contraindications: Hypersensitivity, Caution among patients with hx of cardiac disease, CAD, HTN<br><br>Prototype: Ipratropium<br>Actions:<br>
<br>block parasympathetic response
<br>relieve and prevent the bronchospasm that is characteristic of COPD
<br>Combined with albuterol as first-line drug for bronchospasm from COPD
<br>it is prescribed off-label for the disorder for asthma
<br>Alternative to SABA
<br>Administration: MDI use, Wait 2-3 min between dosages<br>Adverse:<br>
<br>No evidence of fetal harm
<br>Little absorbed by lungs = few systemic changes
<br>Irritation of URI due to drying of nasal mucosa
<br>Bitter taste
<br>May cause epistaxis (nasal)
<br>Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to soy or related to soy or peanut<br><br>Class of bronchodilators used to manage asthma and COPD, commonly includes theophylline and aminophylline<br>
Relaxes smooth muscles of the bronchial airways, reduces airway responsiveness to irritants<br>
Used in chronic asthma management, sometimes in COPD, less commonly used due to narrow therapeutic window and side effects<br>
Nausea, vomiting, insomnia, nervousness, tachycardia, arrhythmias, seizures in toxicity cases<br>
Nursing Considerations (GPT)<br>
Monitor serum drug levels to prevent toxicity<br>
Assess for signs of toxicity such as nausea, restlessness, and arrhythmias<br>
Educate clients to avoid caffeine, as it can increase drug effects<br>
Ensure consistent administration to maintain therapeutic levels<br>
Monitor cardiac status, especially in clients with cardiovascular conditions<br>
Inform clients about the importance of regular blood tests to monitor drug levels<br>
Caution when using in older adults due to increased sensitivity to side effects<br><br><br>Prototype: Beclomethasone<br>
Actions<br>
aerosol inhalation (Qvar) for asthma or as a nasal spray (Beconase AQ, Qnasl) for allergic rhinitis.<br>
first-line drugs for the long-term management of persistent asthma in both children and adults.<br>
3-4 weeks before optimal benefits are obtained.<br>
reduce inflammation, thus decreasing the frequency of asthma attacks.<br>
not used as a rescue inhaler<br>
Adverse<br>
if swallowed, observe for signs of corticosteroid toxicity.<br>
Local effects may include hoarseness, dry mouth, and changes in taste.<br>
Inhaled corticosteroid use has been associated with the development of cataracts in adults.<br>
Long-term intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids may cause growth inhibition in children.<br>
can mask signs of infection: do not use if infected<br>
Oral thrush<br>
Contraindications<br>
Hypersensitivity<br>
The growth of pediatric patients should be monitored carefully because inhaled corticosteroids may reduce growth velocity in some children.<br><br>second-line drugs, considered when other meds failed to manage chronic asthma<br>
mediators of the immune response that are involved in allergic and asthmatic reactions<br>
montelukast (Singulair)<br>
Actions and Uses<br>
prophylaxis of persistent, chronic asthma; exercise-induced bronchospasm; and allergic rhinitis.<br>
prevents airway edema and inflammation by blocking leukotriene receptors in the airways.<br>
Given PO and acts rapidly, although it is not recommended for termination of acute bronchospasm.<br>
Only drug in this class that is approved for pediatric use.<br>
Available in chewable tablets and as granules that are recommended by the manufacturer to be mixed with applesauce, mashed carrots, or ice cream.<br>
Administration Alerts<br>
