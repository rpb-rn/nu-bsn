## Potassium
Functions:
- regulate fluid balance
- muscle contractions:
	- Skeletal muscle:
		- too much = hyperexcited, spasmic, paralyzed (late sign)
		- too low = limp and weak
	- Cardiac Muscle - imbalance causes arrhythmias
	- Smooth Muscle - low K results in hypOactive bowels
- nerve signals
#### Hyperkalemia: high and tight <3
- **Heart** - tight and contracted
	- ST elevation, peaked T waves
	- severe: VFib, arrest
	- hypotension, brady
- **GI** - tight and contracted
	- diarrhea
	- hyperactive bowel sounds
- **Neuromuscular** - tight and contracted
	- paralysis in extremities
	- increased DTR
	- profound muscle weakness (causes resp failure)

profound = severe, assess these first!
Common findings in Hypo and Hyper: confusion, respiratory failure
#### Hypokalemia: low and slow
- **Heart** - low & slow
	- flat T waves
	- ST depression
	- prominent U wave
- **Muscular** - low n slow 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">decreased DTR</mark>
	- muscle cramping (like during prolonged use)
	- **flaccid** paralysis 
- **GI** - low n slow
	- decreased motility
	- hypoactive bowel sounds
	- constipation
	- abdominal distention
	- paralytic ileus (priority = can lead to SBO)

Common findings in Hypo and Hyper: confusion, respiratory failure

## Sodium
functions:
- blood pressure
- blood volume
- pH balance

		where sodium goes, water goes
#### Hypernatremia: big and bloated
- skin
	- flushed - "red and rosy"
	- edema
	- low grade fever: dehydration reduces the body's ability to dissipate heat 
- polydipsia - excessive thirst
- late serious signs:
	- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">swollen dry tongue</mark>**
	- GI: nausea and vomiting
	- increased muscle tone

common in hypo & hyper: restlessness, fatigue, abdominal cramping
#### Hyponatremia: depressed & deflated
- Neuro: seizures & coma
- Cardiac: tachy, weak pulses
- Respiratory Arrest 

common in hypo & hyper: restlessness, fatigue, abdominal cramping

## Chloride: sodium's little sister
- same function as sodium, maintains:
	- blood volume
	- BP
	- pH
### Hyperchloremia: same as sodium
same as sodium:
-  late serious signs:
	- swollen dry tongue
	- GI: nausea and vomiting
	- increased muscle tone
### Hypochloremia: same as sodium
same as low sodium
- excessive diarrhea, vomiting, sweating
- only difference: FEVER

## Magnesium: the sheriff
- maintains law & order in the muscles; calming them down
	- heart
	- uterus
	- DTR
- required for calcium and vitamin D absorption
	- bestfriend: calcium

#### Hypermagnesemia - calm and quiet
- cardiac - calm and quiet
	- heart block
	- prolonged PR interval (heart is calm and quiet)
	- vitals: brady, hypotension
- DTR - calm and quiet; decreased
- Lungs: depressed shallow respirations
- GI: hypoactive bowel sounds

common: confused, irritable, shallow respirations
#### Hypomagnesemia - wild west
- cardiac: torsades de points, T wave inversion, ST inversion
	- severe: VFIB
	- tachy
- DTR - increased
- Eyes: nystagmus
- GI: diarrhea

common: confused, irritable, shallow respirations

## Calcium: 4 B's
functions: keep 4 B's strong
- Bones
- Blood (clotting factors)
- Beats (heart beats)
- Bitch Face - muscle contraction & nerve signaling

#### Hypercalcemia: moans, groans, stones
- constipation (moans) - too much calcium in your shit
- bone pain (groans)
- stone: renal calculi
- decreased DTR
- severe muscle weakness
#### Hypocalcemia: burritos in mexico
- Trousseaus sign: facial twitch
- Chvostek's sign: arm twerk with BP cuff
- diarrhea (food poisoning in mexico)
- Weak 4 B's:
	- Bones: risk for fractures
	- Blood: risk for bleeding
	- Beats: risk for dysrythmias
	- Bitch face: trosseau & chvostek

## Phosphate: inverse of calcium
Function: opposite of calcium
- bone and teeth formation
- helps regulate calcium
- work inversely with calcium

### Hyperphosphatemia: low calcium sx
- Trousseaus sign: facial twitch
- Chvostek's sign: arm twerk with BP cuff
- diarrhea (food poisoning in mexico)
- Weak 3 B's:
	- Bones: risk for fractures
	- Blood: risk for bleeding
	- Beats: risk for dysrhythmias
### Hypophosphatemia: high calcium sx
- constipation (moans)
- bone pain (groans)
- stone: renal calculi
- decreased DTR
- severe muscle weakness
