#acidosis #alkalosis #medsurg #nursing #nurseinthemaking

From nurseinthemaking:

Main organs affecting balance:
- Lungs: respiration expel CO2
	- r. acidosis: impaired ventilatory drive like trauma
- Kidneys
	- urine - excrete/retain H2 and/or HCO3 in urine

**Metabolic**
- Metabolic Alkalosis
	- NGT suctioning/Vomiting - expels H2 from stomach
- Metabolic Acidosis
	- Renal Failure: kidneys fail, acid prevails
	- Diarrhea - intestines are basic environment, expelling too much would tip balance towards acid
	- DKA
		- note: Kussmaul respirations: compensatory

**Respiratory**
- Respiratory Acidosis - low and slow RR
	- Sleep Apnea
	- Head Trauma - low respiratory drive
	- Post-Op - sedation lowers RR
	- CNS Depressants: Benzo, morphine, alcohol
	- Impaired Gas Exchange:
		- Pneumonia
		- COPD
		- Asthma Attacks
- Respiratory Alkalosis
	- Hyperventilation - panic attack, too much CO2 expelled


pH        7.35 ------- 7.45
PaCO2       35 ------- 45     LUNGS
HCO3        22 ------- 26     KIDNEYS
