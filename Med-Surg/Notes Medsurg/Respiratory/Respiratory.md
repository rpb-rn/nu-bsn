[[Acid Base Balance]] => for ABG Values
#### OSA
- episodes of partial or complete collapse of the airway, with decreased SPO2 #osa
- defined by apneic episodes caused by repetitive upper airway obstructions, then arousal causing individual to reopen airway and resume breathing
- leads to poor sleep, loud snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness
	- secondary effect: memory, learning, decision making

Detailed pathophysiology:
- tongue - huge factor, most common structure associated with
- decreased muscle tone of nasopharynx decreases during sleep

Signs and Symptoms:
- loud snoring with breathing cessation for 10 seconds or longer, following by loud snore (arousal)
- may have 1-500 episodes per night
- incidence increases as weight increases
- daytime:
	- chronic fatigue, irritability, moodiness, headache, sleepiness, decreased libido
- nighttime:
	- snoring, gasping, fragmented sleep, nocturia, insomnia, night sweats

Diagnostic Studies:
- history and physical exam
- PSG - polysomnographic test: records brain waves/EEG, blood oxygen, HR, RR, EMG, ECG
	- gold standard for dx of OSA
	- airflow is also measured, with breathing patterns
	- calculated apnea-hypoapnea index (AHI) = # of apneas per hour

**Treatment:**
- mandibular advancement device: prevents tongue and soft tissue from blocking airway
- CPAP: one pressure setting continuously, decreases work of breathing, prevents airway collapse
- BiPAP: different pressures on exhale/inhale, for removing CO2, more complex settings
- Surgical:
	- tonsillectomy
	- resection of pharyngeal soft tissue
	- partial removal of soft palate and uvula
	- nasal septoplasty
	- maxillofacial surgeries 
- Medications:
	- ==Modafinil (Provigil)== reduces daytime sleepiness
		- inhibits dopamine reuptake
		- adverse: anxiety, HA, nausea
	- ==Protriptyline (Triptil)== - increases respiratory drive, improves airway muscle tone
		- taken at bedtime
		- also an antidepressant (tricyclic antidepressant)
		- adverse: anxiety, confusion, headache
		- taken with CPAP/BiPAP

Nursing responsibilities:
- facilitate effective sleep environment: dim lights, draw curtains, door slightly closed
- provide humidified O2, reposition to one side, encourage deep breathing exercises
- elevate head of bed
- encourage lifestyle changes: smoking cessation, weight

Risk Factors
- obesity
- larger neck circumference
- high fat around pharynx
- nasal congestion
- thickened pharyngeal walls
- facial malformations
- most common in overweight to obese

Effects on Health (other diseases it can lead to):
- systemic HTN, cardiac arythmia, heart failure, stroke, MI
- contributes to cognitive deficits: irritability, errors, accidents, moodiness, depression
- nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
- daytime drowsiness, loss of independence

Aging adult considerations:
- more contributing factors:
	- loss of teeth, muscle dysfunction, other comorbidities (stroke, dementia, HF, edema)
	- sleepiness may be attributed to old age vs OSA symptom
#### COPD

What it is:
- airway restriction caused by noxious gas and/or particle exposure #copd
- can be caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema
	- COPD is a broad term that includes bronchitis and emphysema

Emphysema
- permanent enlargement of airspaces and destruction of airspace walls
- affects respiratory bronchioles, alveolar sacs, ducts, alveoli

Chronic Bronchitis
- inflammation of bronchial tubes, leading to increased mucus production and coughing

Clinical Presentation:
- dyspnea, chronic cough, sputum production
- exertional dyspnea = most common early manifestation
- wheezing, chest tightness
- barrel chest - severe and late sign
- decreased breath sounds, crackles at lung bases
- sit leaning forward slightly = use of accessory muscles of neck
- Pursed lip expiration
- ==Hoover's sign== = drawing in of the lower ribs while inhaling
- Neck vein distention due to intrathoracic pressure during expiration

Causes:
- common: cigarette smoke => more mucus production => cilliary function decreases => inflammation
- thickened and fibrosed alveoli => damaged macrophages => more infection

Treatment:
- goal: control symptoms, not die, improve QOL
- SABA , LABA, inhaled corticosteroids, anticholinergics, methylxanthines, LAMA (antimuscarinic agents)
	- methylxanthines - relax smooth muscles in airway (Theophylline)
- Vaccines: influenza, pneumococcal (PVC13), RSV (>60yo)

Diagnosis:
- CAPTURE questionnaire
- weak expiratory flow
- PFT especially spirometry => gold standard of diagnosing COPD
	- spirometry before and after bronchodilator to determine airflow limitation is reversible
	- Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1)
	- forced Vital Capacity (FVC)
- SPO2
- CXR - to rule out dyspnea/sputum
- CT - determine severity of disease

Systemic Effects:
- increased mortality rate from respiratory failure
- weight loss, skeletal muscle dysfunction, poor nutrition
- loss of muscle cells
- decreased physical activity
- Cardiac: CHF

Complications:
- thromboembolic disease
- lung cancer
- respiratory failure

Risk Factors:
- female
- smoking = MOST IMPORTANT
- responsiveness to allergens
- exposure to dust/fumes
- asthma
- chronic lung disease

Nursing Interventions:
- O2
- promote rest
- breathing exercises
#### PNEUMONIA

**What is it?**
- umbrella term used to refer infection of lung parenchyma caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses #pneumonia
- inflammation => exudate/secretions= > occlusion of bronchi => airway compromise
- consolidation = air in small airways is replaced by fluid in lungs

**Clinical Presentation**

#### Pneumothorax

**What is it?**
- air that collects within pleural cavity d/t leak from lung into parietal and visceral pleura #pneumothorax
	- creates pressure causing lung to collapse

Types:
- Traumatic Pneumothorax - blunt or penetrating trauma creates one-way valve into pleural space
	- air goes in but does not go out
	- 2 subtypes:
		- Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) - without underlying lung disease but in the presence of asymptomatic bullae or blebs that rupture
		- Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (SSP) - lung disease is present, most commonly, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Other Classifications:
- Open Pneumo - air entering through an open wound in the chest.
- Iatrogenic - type of traumatic; caused by a medical treatment or procedure (thoracentesis or biopsy)
- Tension Pneumo -  severe form, air enters the chest cavity, becomes trapped, and cannot be expelled

**Clinical Presentation**
- chest pain, SOB
- hpotension
- distended neck veins or hypotension from an increased central venous pressure
- tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, hypoxia
- pleuritic chest pain radiating to shoulder

**Treatment**

	- after: thoracostomy tube or catheter in 5th ICS MCL
	- ensure drainage system is below catheter
- O2
- analgesia

**Nursing Considerations & Interventions**

**What is it?**
- collection of blood in pleural space: between visceral and parietal pleura #hemothorax
- often associated with traumatic thoracic injuries from blunt or penetrating injury 
- life-threatening due to hemodynamic and respiratory compromise
- blood limits airway functioning, ==**increases vascular resistance = leads to cardiac arrest**==, death

**Clinical Presentation**
