#### ASTHMA
-airway inflammation that leads to airway obstruction (mucosal edema)
-exacerbated by mucus production, clogging airway (more pronounced during expiration)
-Hyperventilation: rapid breathing that causes reduced carbon dioxide in arterial blood (hypocapnic)
#asthma 

**Remodelling**
- caused by chronic airway inflammation, permanent changes in tissue and structure of the airway wall
- changes include airway wall thickness and smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia
- no return

**Signs and Symptoms**:
- wheezing
- coughing (usually at night), can be dry or productive
- chest tightness
- dyspnea

**Lab and Diagnostic Testing:**
 - Physical Exam
	 - adventitious length sounds = > complications
	 - wheezing => bronchospasm or impending respiratory failure
	 - resp rate
 - PFT
 - Lab
	 - Urea
	 - Electrolytes
	 - ABG - determines hypoxemia and acidosis
		 - hypoxemia - low level of O2 in blood
		 - pH: 7.35 to 7.45
		- PaCO2: 35 to 45 mm Hg
		- PaO2: 80 to 100 mm Hg
		- HCO3: 21 to 27
		- O2sat: 95 to 100%
	- ECG - check for sinus tachy
 - Pulse Oxymetry - if severe, late finding
 - Peak Flow Meter - percentage of expected peak flow, compare to baseline
 - Spirometry - reveals obstructive pattern that response to salbutamol

**Treatment:**
- O2
- SABA: albuterol, levalbuterol, terbulatine (relax airway muscles)
- Corticosteroids: budesonide, fluticasone, beclomethasone (to reduce inflamation and improve airflow)

- **Asthma Medications**
    - Categorized into quick relief, rescue, and long-acting control medications.
    - Adjusted based on asthma severity.
    - Common groups: SABAs, LABAs, glucocorticoids, muscarinic antagonists.
    - **Beta-Agonists**: Facilitate bronchodilation, relax smooth muscle.
    - **Glucocorticoids**: Decrease lung inflammation, aid short- and long-term breathing.
    - **Muscarinic Antagonists**: Block inflammatory effects, added to beta-agonists or glucocorticoids.
    - Aim: Prevent and control asthma symptoms.
- **Quick-Relief Medications**
    - **SABAs** (e.g., albuterol, levalbuterol): Immediate relief, prevent exercise-induced asthma.
        - Adverse reactions: tremors, tachycardia, CNS stimulation.
    - **Anti-Cholinergic** (e.g., ipratropium): Prevent respiratory muscle tightening.
        - Takes effect in 30 min, lasts 3-6 hours.
- **Long-Term Control Medications**
    - **Inhaled Corticosteroids** (e.g., beclomethasone, budesonide): Decrease airway inflammation.
        - Common adverse reactions: oral thrush, dysphonia, respiratory infections.
        - Use spacer and rinse mouth post-inhalation.
    - **LABAs** (e.g., formoterol, salmeterol): Control nighttime symptoms, prevent exercise-induced asthma.
        - Start within 2-30 min, last 12+ hours.
    - **Long-Acting Anti-Cholinergic Agents** (e.g., ipratropium/albuterol, tiotropium): Relieve symptoms, reduce inflammation.
        - Adverse reactions: urinary retention, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, respiratory issues.

**Systemic Effects**
- perfusion - can lead to hypoxemia
- neurological - damaged brain cells d/t hypoxemia, leads to death
	- memory loss, poor judgement, inattentiveness, decreased muscle coordination
- Renal - hypoxemia leads to decreased renal tissue perfusion => fluid, electrolyte imbalance
- Mobility - impaired QOL, worse health outcomes

**Risk Factors:**
- genetics
- tobacco exposure
- environmental particulates, allergens, infections, pollution
- chemicals, perfume, candles, changing weather
- allergic sensitization - repeated exposure to allergen increases risk
- obesity
- more common in males prior to puberty, but opposite after

**Phenotypes or Subcategories of Asthma:**
- Allergic Asthma
	- most common
	- begins in childhood 
	- usually accompanied by family hx of allergic disorders/exczema
- Nonallergic Asthma
	- less common
	- common in adults, rare in children
	- poor response to treatment other than corticosteroids
- Aspirin-sensitive Asthma
	- flare-up when taking aspirin or NSAIDs
	- accompanied by chronic rhinitis or nasal inflammation
- Exercise-Induced Asthma
	- if client exercises to a certain capacity, they will flare up
	- managed by pre and post meds

**Comorbidities**:
- obesity can exacerbate SOB
- rhinitis
- vocal cord dysfunction (voice box does not open correctly)
- GERD
- OSA

#### STATUS ASTHMATICUS

- rapid onset asthma attack
- severe asthma
- Emergency! Very life-threatening
- potential acute ventilatory failure or death (d/t hypoxia or hypercapnia)
- requires ventiation
- 10% mortality rate in ICU

Important: give bronchodilator first before oxygen

Risk Factors:
- poor recognition of dyspnea
- usually have other comorbidities
- previous episode of S.A., prior intubation
- CAD as a result of adverse reactions from meds

Impact:
- airways close prematurely when the client exhales leading to an increase in the volume that remains in the lung (functional residual capacity) and air trapping
- leads to hypoxemia that then causes lactic acidosis
- stress of having asthma coupled with comorbidities that are associated with it can lead to increases in asthmatic episodes
- respiratory system of the aging adult undergoes physiological changes and can mimic the presence of airway obstruction

Signs/Symptoms:
- SOB, unable to speak full sentences
- chest tightness
- accessory muscle use
- late signs: drowsiness, confusion, cyanosis
- sx do not develop at the same time
- mucus plug can lead to asphyxia
- resp acidosis
- wheezing may not be present on auscultation
	- absent wheezes = indicate retained secretions and deteriorating respiratory function
- Alkalosis if hyperventilating

Diagnostic:
- breath sounds
- SPO2
- ABG
- BP - monitor for ==pulsus paradoxus== (When blood pressure drops by more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration.)
- LOC & fatigue
- PEFR - peak expiratory flow rate; if less than 50% of best = status asthmaticus
- PEV
- CBC - check for WBC elevation

Systemic Effects:
- Perfusion - decreased left ventricular filling and outflow (look for pulsus paradoxus)
- MSK - rhabdo from excessive accessory muscle use, hypercapnia, steroids, neuromuscular blocking agents

Treatment:
- SABA - relief from bronchospasm
- oral or IV corticosteroids - decrease inflammation of airway
- O2 for cyanosis, dyspnea
- IV fluids for hydration
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Magnesium sulfate</mark> for smooth muscle relaxation
- critical care until symptoms resolve or after 24 hours, then focus on education re: meds and irritants
