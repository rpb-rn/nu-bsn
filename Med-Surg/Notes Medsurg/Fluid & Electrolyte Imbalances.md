### Fluid Volume Deficit / Excess
#### Deficit
**What is it**
- A state where fluid output exceeds fluid intake
- loss of sodium and water leads to a decrease in circulating volume.

**Clinical Presentation**
- tachy, dry mucosa, hypotension, thirst, decreased skin turgor, flat neck veins
- decreased UOP, muscle cramps, lightheadedness, orthostatic hypotension
- when in hypovolemic shock: clammy, cold, cyanotic, confusion
- Lab values:
	- Hct - increased (blood is more concentrated)
	- Na - increased
	- Serum Osmolality - increased
	- BUN - increased
	- UA-gravity: increased

**Treatment**
- fluid replacement; orally preferred
- IVF if oral
	- Isotonic Crystalloids - NS
	- balanced isotonic crystalloids - LR
	- Hypotonic - 0.45% NaCl, 0.33% NaCl
	- Hypertonic: D20, 3% NaCl, D50

**Nursing Considerations**
- encourage drinking of 2-3 liters per day
- note falls risk d/t orthostatic hypotension
- strict I/O

**Diagnostic**
- CBC, hematocrit, electrolytes
- BUN, CK
- urine specific gravity

**Causes:**
- output > input (e.g. running marathons)
- inability to ingest fluids
- diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea, GI bleed, excessive sweating, third space losses
- burns

**Risk Factors**
- CKD
- central diabetes insipidus -  rare condition that causes excessive thirst and urination
- 65 and older
- dementia (forgets to drink)

**Complications**
- cerebral hypoperfusion
- organ failure
- cardiac damage
#### Excess
**What is it**
- excess of TBW and sodium (total body water)
- increase of fluid volume in the extracellular space
- intake > needs

**Clinical Manifestations**
- edema, hypervolemia, or both
- hypertension, pulmonary congestion, and edema of the extremities
	- Pulmonary E - tachypnea, worsening dyspnea, pink frothy sputum, hypoxia, and jugular vein distention.
- pitting edema, dyspnea, and crackles in lung fields
- ascites in liver cirrhosis
- increased weight
- Labs:
	- BNP - may be elevated (hormone that indicates cardiac pressure and volume overload); brain natriuretic peptide
		- normal: <100 pg/mL, above 400 is critical (mostly likely HF)

**Treatment**
- treat underlying cause
- low sodium diet, fluid restriction, increase protein
- diuretics for edema and fluid

**Nursing Considerations**
- restrict to 2g of sodium per day
- restrict to 1.5-2L of fluid per day
- weigh daily, assess for edema, heart sounds, lung sounds, VS

**Diagnostic**
- BNP
- ECG to rule out cardiac dysfunction
- CBC, electrolytes, LFT, Urea, CK

**Causes**
- HF
	- decreased tissue perfusion => water retention
- Liver Disease = > reduced renal perfusion, results in edema and ascites
	- ascites - Fluid collects within the peritoneal cavity as a result of liver disease or dysfunction.
- Kidney Disease, AKI
- Electrolyte or acid-base imbalance
- iatrogenic: excessive IV fluids
- Polydipsia - excessive ingestion of fluid
	- inappropriate ADJ, diabetes insipidus, psychogenic

**Risk Factors**
- ESLD, HF, kidney disease
- pregnancy, pre-eclampsia
### Sodium
	normal range: 136-145 mEq/L
##### Hypernatremia
**What is it** #hypernatremia
- greater than 145 mEq/L
- excessive fluid is lost through body systems (GI, GU, renal, respiratory)
- usually in conjunction with hypovolemia

**Clinical Manifestations**
- usually presented with neuro symptoms (<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">brain is sensitive to sodium imbalance</mark>)
	- confused or exhibit altered sensorium
	- restlessness, irritability, and twitching of muscles
- fatigue, extreme thirst, headache
- sleeping issues, tachypnea, and restlessness
- hypotension, dry mucous membranes, and decreased skin turgor
- Compilations:
	- cerebral edema => may lead to brain damage, death
	- acute kidney failure

**Treatment**
- oral rehydration
- treat underlying cause
- IVF with NS or balanced crystalloid
- correct slowly (reduce by no more 12 mEq/L in 24 hour)

**Nursing Considerations**
- encourage oral fluids
- do not administer IVF rapidly - may result in cerebral edema (seizures)

**Causes**
- vomiting, burns, and profuse diaphoresis.
- decreased water intake
- diuresis caused by: meds, hyperglycemia, or diabetes insipidus
- diet: seawater or salt poisoning, or administration of hypertonic intravenous fluids

**Risk Factors**
- gastroenteritis, diabetes, and kidney disease
- impaired thirst response, excessive sweating, and medications
- 65 and older
##### Hyponatremia
**What is it** #hyponatremia
- excess of total body water in relation to total body sodium content
- relative to total body fluid:
	- Euvolemic hyponatremia - increase of TBW without an alteration in body sodium or ECF
	- Hypervolemic hyponatremia - greater increase in TBW relative to body sodium
- can be chronic or acute

**Clinical Manifestations**
- brain is at the highest risk for injury as a consequence of cellular edema
	- confusion,<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> lethargy or fatigue</mark>, seizures, and possibly resulting in death
	- hyperactive reflexes 
	- decreased attebtuib
- often asymptomatic, but if Na < 115 mEq/dL, more severe neurological manifestations are evident
- severe = emergency!

**Treatment**
- treat cause
	- meds = discontinue if possible; if not, restrict fluids
	- hypovolemia = administer IVF NS
	- SIADH (Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) = vasopressin
	- HF = loop diuretics with sodium restriction

**Nursing Considerations**
- fluid restrictions, high protein diet
- educate: athletes drink fluids with electrolytes
- constant neuro checks
- monitor for edema, p.edema, UOP, I/O

**Causes**
- fluid loss is replaced by sodium-deficient fluids
- administration of hypotonic intravenous fluids
- Diuretics, NSAIDs, antidepressants => decrease Na
- Physiological:
	- renal: diuretic
	- extrarenal: bleeding, burns, diarrhea, vomiting, third spacing of fluids 
		- third spacing -excessive fluid moves from the intravascular space into the interstitial space
- Acute Hyponatremia: within 24 hours, e.g. runner drank water only
- Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (**SIADH**) - body produces too much ADH
- Thiazide Diuretics - increases risk

| Disorder           |    Na    | Serum Osmo | Urine Osmo |
| ------------------ |:--------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| SIADH              | ​​​​​​​↓ |  ​​​​​​​↓  |     ↑      |
| Dehydration        |    ↑     |     ↑      |     ↑      |
| Diabetes Insipidus |    ↑     |     ↑      |  ​​​​​​​↓  |

**Risk Factors**
- alcoholism
- 65 and older
- diuretics, antidepressants, NSAIDs
- see causes

**Systemic Effects**
- increases risk of osteoporosis = + risk of fractures

### Potassium
	K - 3.5-5 mEq/L
##### Hypokalemia
**What is it** #hypokalemia
- normal range for an adult is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L
- K is regulated by kidneys

**Clinical Manifestations**
- dysrhythmias
- muscle weakness, nausea, abdominal distention, vomiting, muscle cramps, impaired renal function
- cardiac: U waves and flattening of the T wave 
- symptoms appear when less than 3 mEq/L

**Treatment**
- oral potassium unless the client cannot tolerate 
- if severe, IV infusion with 10-20 mEq/hr
- if caused by meds, change the meds

**Nursing Considerations**
- oral K can cause Gi discomfort
- monitor: mental confusion, hypotension, and cardiac dysrhythmias
- Dextrose - increases incidence of hypokalemia due to insulin secretion
- IV site - monitor for irritation during infusion

**Diagnostic**
- BMP
- spot urine or 24hr urine test to determine kidney K excretion
- determine if renal or non-renal (aldosteronism or diuretic administration)
- ABG - determine acidosis/alkalosis
- ECG

**Causes**
- Renal
	- diuresis
	- aldosteronism
- GI
	- decreased intake
