### Overview

3 Phases:
- preop - begins as soon as client is scheduled for surgery
- intraop
- postop - ends with transfer or discharge

Nurse primary role: advocate

**Classification of Surgical Procedures:**

**By Purpose:**
- diagnostic
- ablative - remove body part or tissue to destroy it (colectomy, removal of tumors)
- palliative - provides relief/lessen pain
- constructive - restore lost function that was present in birth
- restorative/reconstructive - repair or restore a missing body part/organ
- transplant
- cosmetic

**Seriousness:**
- major - risky
- minor

**Urgency:**
- emergent - ASAP, within minutes
- urgent - life-saving, within hours of presentation
- expedited - not emergency, within days
- elective - not urgent, based on convenience

ASA Physical Class system
- Class I-VI (healthy to braindead)
	- Class I - normal healthy adult
	- Class II - mild medical condition
	- Class V - critical condition who will die w/o procedure
	- Class VI - brain dead, organs to be donate


**AORN Perioperative Patient Focused Model:**
- 4 dimensions: Health System, Safety, Behavioral Responses and Physiological Responses.
### Preop
Informed Consent:
	- needs:
		- procedure, potential risks, type of anesthesia, type of anesthesia, risk of anesthesia, any other potential procedures during surgery, postop plan, potential complications, risk and benefits, complications to client
	- provider explains and obtains, nurse verifies and witnesses informed consent
	- family member or guardian if patient is unconscious or mentally incompetent

Preop Tasks:
- medical surgical hx obtained, check allergies
- baseline head-to-to, VS, height, weight
- prep skin: avoid shaving if possible
- NPO and meds
- hygiene, remove all jewelry
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"></mark><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">remove nail polish</mark> to notice signs of cyanosis
- don surgical gown and cap, slippers

Preop Diagnostic Tests:
- CBC, Hgb, Hct
- Coags: PT, INR, aPTT, platelet
- Metabolic: electrolyte, ck, BUN
- HCG, urinalysis
- CXR, ECG
- Bloodtype & screen: if possibility of heavy bleeding (hip replacement)

### Intraop
- phase start/end: operating table to PACU/ICU
- Nurse role: circulating/scrub
	- know type of surgery & anesthesia
	- assist, client positioning
	- maintain aseptic environment, document, monitor complications

### Postop
- phase start/end: PACU until recovery from procedure
- pain assessment- begins in preop stage to establish baseline pain

**Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)**
- surgical protocol implemented to drive client-centered process postoperatively to improve client outcomes
- must involve whole team
- focuses: mobility, nutrition, pain, manage N/V, discontinue IV fluids ASAP, continue client education

### Education
- begins in preop stage
- teach specific equipment, medications, recovery exercises (breathing, coughing, spirometer, leg exercises, position changes), pain management, coping techniques, etc.

**Diaphragm Breathing Exercise**
- lie supine, hands on stomach, inhale nose, exhale pursed lips, repeat 5 times

**Deep Breathing Exercise**
- sit back, inhale 4 seconds nose, hold breath for 8 seconds, exhale 8 seconds  pursed lips, repeat 3 times

**Incentive Spirometer**
- sit, set goal marker, breath in, once goal reached, hold for as long as possible
- exhale slowly, pause then repeat 10 times
- done every hour for 10 times

Postop Education Topics:
- proper nutrition
- meds
- lifestyle
- wound care
- follow-up

### Miscellaneous Stuff
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Malignant Hyperthermia</mark> - genetic disorder triggered by anesthesia/succinylcholines, life-threatening
	- treatment: dantrolene
	- tachycardia, tachypnea, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperkalemia, hypercarbia, and muscular rigidity.
- Note: postop clients are at increased risk of:
	- delayed wound healing
	- infection
	- increased length of stay
	- aspiration
	- DVT
- Note: OSA = higher risk of difficult intubation
- Note: PACU priority: maintain airway and respiratory status
- Note: cardiac postop = increased risk for hypothermia
- Dehiscence Treatment: cover with sterile dressing soaked in saline and then notify provider
	- prevention: limit vomiting, coughing, constipation
- Aldrete Score - scoring system determines if patient can be safely discharged  from PACU
	- must be 8-10 for discharge
	- criteria: oxygenation, RR, circulation, LOC, activity

### Transplant Nursing
- similar to periop nursing
-  nurse provides support, care, fluids, and blood if ordered and monitors the client closely for organ rejection
- Note precautions: immunocompromised from the medications and procedures
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Note: critical time in first 24 hours after transplant</mark>
- main complication: rejection of organ

**Types of Organ Rejection:**
- **Hyperacute rejection** - minutes or hours after transplantation, caused by antibodies
- **Acute rejection** - caused by certain lymphocytes that detect antigens in the transplanted tissue or organ days or weeks after transplantation
- **Chronic rejection** - months or years following organ or tissue transplantation.
