### Valvular Dysfunctions
**What is it**
- abnormal function or structure of heart valve leading to impaired heart blood flow
- can either be inability to fully open or close:
	- stenosis - narrowing, valves do not completely open
	- regurgitation - backflow; valves do not close completely

**Causes**
- congenital
- rheumatic disease -  infection from strep throat that was not treated promptly with antibiotics, leading to scarring of the heart valve
- endocarditis - infection of the inner layer of the heart, is caused by septicemia or intravenous drug use
- Heart diseases: MI, hypertension, atherosclerosis of aorta, HF
- Autoimmune: lupus, marfan syndrome, high dose radiation, aging process
- Risk factors: age (over 75), inactivity, high fat/sodium/sugar diet, obesity, family hx, defibrilators/pacemakers
	- valves become stiff and thick which cause valvular heart disease
- Comorbidities: HTN, HLD, AFib, DM

**Clinical Manifestations**
- chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, weakness, dyspnea, arrhythmia
- heart failure symptoms: edema, ascites
- abdominal pain from large liver

**Treatment**
- Drug Therapy:
	- Beta blockers: lower BP/HR
	- CCB - C = calms the heart (low BP, low HR)
	- Digoxin -  Increase contractility, decrease HR, cardiac remodeling!
	- Diuretics
	- Vasodilators
- Surgical
	- Valve repair
	- balloon valvuloplasty - minimally invasive procedure that expands the openings of stenosed valves
	- valve replacement - from cow, pig, human, mechanical/artificial
- Lifestyle

**Diagnostic**
- echocardiogram - gold standard, measures pressure on each valve, EF
- CXR, MRI, 
- ECG - detects enlarged chambers (abrnomal)
- Cardiac Catherization - aka angiogram, catheter is inserted into either an artery, dye used, then x-ray
- Stress Test - exercise to determine capacity

### Cardiomyopathy
**What is it**
- group of diseases affecting the heart muscle, leading to structural and functional abnormalities.
	- **dilated (DCM)** - most common
		- enlargement of the ventricles with reduced systolic function and decreased EF
		- Causes: Idiopathic, ischemic heart disease, alcohol abuse, viral infections, toxins, genetic mutations
		- symptoms: chest discomfort, peripheral edema, exponentially increasing levels of fatigue as the condition progresses, and exertional dyspnea. 
	- **hypertrophic (HCM)** - thickened ventricular walls, most commonly affecting the interventricular septum, leading to diastolic dysfunction.
		- causes: Genetic mutations
		- symptoms: fatigue, syncopal episodes, chest discomfort or palpitations, exhaustion, and dyspnea
	- **restrictive (RCM)** - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Stiffened</mark> ventricular walls due to fibrosis or infiltration, leading to impaired diastolic filling while systolic function is preserved
		- poor prognosis; least common
		- causes: Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, radiation therapy, idiopathic.
		- symptoms: similar to HF with DCM/HCM
	- **arrhythmogenic (ACM)** - Fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, leading to arrhythmias and structural changes
		- Causes: Genetic mutations (autosomal dominant), familial
		- symptoms: ascites, increased JVD, and lethal dysrhythmias, VFib, VTach, including manifestations of other CMs

**Clinical Manifestations**
**Treatment**
- Pharmacological
	- Fluid overload: diuretics and vasodilators
	- ACEi, ARBs, BB, CCB, Diuretic
- Surgical
	- DCM or RCM: heart transplant, LVAD (left ventricular assist device): can be permanent or temporary fix until transplant
	- Invasive:
		- septal myectomy - remove portions of hypertrophied ventricular septum
		- alcohol septal ablation
- Lifestyle

**Nursing Considerations**
- fluid restriction: 2L/day

**Diagnostic**
- Echocardiogram
- BNP/NT-proBNP levels (heart failure markers)
- Troponin - indicates myocardial injury
- genetic testing (for familial cases)
- MRI - detailed imaging
- CXR - cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion
- ECG
