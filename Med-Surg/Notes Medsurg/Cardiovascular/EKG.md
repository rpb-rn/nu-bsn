### Cardiac Rhythms
##### Basics
- P Wave: Represents atrial depolarization; should be upright and precede each QRS.
- PR Interval: Time from atrial depolarization to ventricular depolarization (normal: 0.12â€“0.20 seconds).
- QRS Complex: Represents ventricular depolarization; normal duration <0.12 seconds.
- T Wave: Represents ventricular repolarization; upright in most leads.
- ST Segment: Should be isoelectric; elevation or depression indicates ischemia or injury.
- QT Interval: Represents total ventricular activity (depolarization + repolarization); prolonged QT may indicate risk for arrhythmias.

Strip Timing
- small square - .04 second
- large square (5 smalls) = .20 seconds
- 1 strip =  6 seconds (that means multiply QRS's by 10 = heart rate per minute)
##### Sinus Brady
- **ECG Description:** Regular rhythm, rate <60 bpm, normal P wave before each QRS.
- **Causes:** Athletes, medications (beta-blockers, digoxin), hypothyroidism, vagal stimulation.
- **Clinical Presentation:** Dizziness, fatigue, syncope, or asymptomatic.
- **Treatment:** None if asymptomatic, atropine or pacing if symptomatic.
##### Sinus Tachy
- **ECG Description:** Regular rhythm, rate >100 bpm, normal P wave before each QRS.
- **Causes:** Fever, anxiety, pain, dehydration, anemia, hyperthyroidism.
- **Clinical Presentation:** Palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, or asymptomatic.
- **Treatment:** Treat underlying cause (e.g., fluids for dehydration, antipyretics for fever).
##### PVC - Premature V. Contraction
- **Mnemonic/Description:** A heartbeat that starts in the wrong part of the heart, causing a random extra thud.
	- **Rate:** Depends on underlying rhythm.
	- **Rhythm:** Irregular.
	- **P Wave:** present with every QRS except it is absent with PVC.
	- **PR Interval:** Not measurable for PVC.
	- **QRS Complex:** >0.12 seconds (wide).
- **Causes:** Electrolyte imbalance, ischemia, stimulants.
- **Clinical Presentation:** Palpitations or asymptomatic.
- **Treatment:** Treat cause, beta-blockers if frequent.
##### PAC - Premature A. Contraction
- **Mnemonic/Description:** Early P wave, normal QRS, An early, out-of-sync beat from the top chambers of the heart
	- **Rate:** Depends on underlying rhythm.
	- **Rhythm:** Irregular due to premature beat.
	- **P Wave:** Abnormal shape, early.
	- **PR Interval:** Normal or shortened.
	- **QRS Complex:** <0.12 seconds.
- **Causes:** Stress, caffeine, electrolyte imbalance.
- **Clinical Presentation:** Palpitations or asymptomatic.
- **Treatment:** Avoid triggers, rarely needed.
##### First-Degree Heart Block
- **Mnemonic/Description:** Prolonged PR interval.
	- **Rate:** Usually normal.
	- **Rhythm:** Regular.
	- **P Wave:** Normal, one per QRS.
	- **PR Interval:** >0.20 seconds (prolonged).
	- **QRS Complex:** <0.12 seconds.
- **Causes:** Aging, medications (beta-blockers, digoxin).
- **Clinical Presentation:** Asymptomatic.
- **Treatment:** None unless symptomatic.
##### AFib
- **Mnemonic/Description:** Irregularly irregular, no P waves. atria quiver instead of contracting effectively, causing irregular heartbeats and impaired blood flow
	- **Rate:** Variable (ventricular rate).
	- **Rhythm:** Irregularly irregular.
	- **P Wave:** Absent, fibrillatory waves.
	- **PR Interval:** Not measurable.
	- **QRS Complex:** <0.12 seconds.
- **Causes:** Hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, alcohol use, obesity, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">sleep apnea</mark>, post-surgery, or idiopathic
- **Clinical Presentation:** 
	- Cardiac: Irregular pulse, palpitations, pulse deficit (apical vs peripheral pulse are different), chest pain
	- General: fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath
	- Can be asymptomatic. 
	- Risk of thromboembolism (e.g., stroke) due to blood stasis in atria.
- **Treatment:**
	- Rate Control - beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin
	- Rhythm Control - antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion
	- Anticoagulation - warfarin, DOACS (apixaban, etc)
	- Interventional - ablation, pacemaker
##### Atrial Flutter
- **Mnemonic/Description:** Sawtooth flutter waves.
	- **Rate:** Atrial 250-350 bpm; ventricular varies.
	- **Rhythm:** Regular or irregular.
	- **P Wave:** Sawtooth appearance.
	- **PR Interval:** Not measurable.
	- **QRS Complex:** <0.12 seconds.
- **Causes:** Similar to AFib (hypertension, CAD).
- **Clinical Presentation:** Palpitations, fatigue.
- **Treatment:** Rate control, cardioversion, anticoagulation.
##### SVT
- **Mnemonic/Description:** Narrow, rapid QRS, hidden P waves.
	- **Rate:** >150 bpm.
	- **Rhythm:** Regular.
	- **P Wave:** Often hidden in QRS.
	- **PR Interval:** Not measurable.
	- **QRS Complex:** <0.12 seconds.
- **Causes:** Re-entry circuits, stress, stimulants.
- **Clinical Presentation:** Palpitations, dizziness, chest discomfort.
- **Treatment:** Vagal maneuvers, adenosine, beta-blockers, cardioversion if unstable.
