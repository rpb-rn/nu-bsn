### Endocarditis

##### **What is it**  
- Inflammation of the endocardium, typically affecting the heart valves, caused by infection (infective endocarditis) or, rarely, non-infectious processes.
- endo = inner, itis = inflammation. endocarditis = inflammation of the inner heart

##### **Causes**

- **Infectious:** Bacteria (_Staphylococcus aureus_, _Streptococcus viridans_, _Enterococcus_), fungi (_Candida_, _Aspergillus_), less commonly viruses.
	- most common type
	- mold or bacterial vegetation on the valves
	- more common on L side (aortic and mitral/bi valve)
- **Non-Infectious:** Autoimmune conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus â€“ Libman-Sacks endocarditis), malignancies.

##### **Risk Factors**

- Prosthetic heart valves
- Congenital heart defects
- Rheumatic heart disease
- History of endocarditis
- IV drug use
- Poor dental hygiene or invasive dental procedures => strep throat (how creator of muppets died)
- Indwelling catheters or central lines
- Immunosuppression (e.g., HIV, chemotherapy).

##### **Clinical Manifestations**

**CLOT** mnemonic
- **C**lots in heart and body
- **L**ung fluids - crackles & spleen enlarged d/t heart failure & infection
- **O**vearheated - fever
- **T**oo little oxygen = signs of heart failure

- **General Symptoms:** Fever, fatigue, night sweats, malaise, weight loss.
- **Cardiac Symptoms:** New or changing heart murmur, signs of heart failure (demand>output)
- **Peripheral Signs:**
    - Petechiae (small red spots on skin or mucosa)
    - Splinter hemorrhages (linear streaks under nails)
    - Janeway lesions (painless, flat red spots on palms/soles)
    - Osler nodes (painful nodules on fingers/toes)
    - Roth spots (retinal hemorrhages with pale centers).
- **Complications:** Embolic events (e.g., stroke, pulmonary embolism), abscess formation, septicemia.

##### **Treatment**

- **Medications:**
    - IV antibiotics for 4-6 weeks (based on blood culture results).
    - Antifungals if fungal endocarditis is confirmed.
- **Surgical Intervention:** Valve repair or replacement if extensive damage, persistent infection, or complications (e.g., heart failure, abscess).

##### **Nursing Considerations**

- Monitor for signs of embolic events (neurological changes, limb ischemia).
- Assess for heart failure (dyspnea, edema, fatigue).
- Administer antibiotics on schedule and monitor for side effects.
- Educate on completing full antibiotic course.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Encourage proper dental hygiene to prevent recurrence.</mark>
- Monitor for fever and new murmurs, indicating treatment failure.

##### **Diagnostic**
- **Blood Cultures:** Positive in most cases, with at least two sets needed before antibiotics.
- **Echocardiography:**
    - Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to detect vegetations, valve damage, or abscess.
- **Labs:** Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), leukocytosis, anemia.
- **ECG:** May show conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias.
- **Other Tests:** Imaging to detect embolic complications (e.g., CT for stroke, pulmonary embolism).
