#### **What is it** 
- heart is not able to meet the needs of the systemic circulatory system
- leads to inadequate tissue perfusion and fluid overload.

#### **Causes**
- CAD, MI, diabetes
- Uncontrolled arrythmias, hypertension, myocarditis, congenital heart disease
- non structural causes: thyrotoxicosis, anemia, thiamine deficiencies, pregnancy

#### **Risk Factors**
- family hx COPD, CAD, HTN
- chronic infection
- DM
- obesity, alcohol abuse

#### **Clinical Manifestations**
- Depends on which side is affected
- **Left Side**
	- Pulmonary congestion: crackles/rales, cough w/ <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">frothy or blood tinged sputum</mark>
	- fatigue, weakness, dyspnea on exertion
	- orthopnea (SOB when supine)
	- cyanosis, S3 present
	- paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND = party next door)
- **Right Side**
	- systemic congestion: ascites, peripheral edema, generalized swelling, enlarged liver/spleen
		- sudden weight gain (3 lbs in 1 day or 5 lbs in 7 days = VERY BAD)
	- chest pain, murmurs, palpitations
	- JVD
- **Biventricular** - both ventricles
	- combination of both symptoms of L and R side HF (systemic and pulmonary congestion)
	- point of maximum impulse (PMI) displaced to one side

#### **Treatment**
- Pharmacologic (see [[Pharmacology I/Heart Failure]])
	- ABCDD - Aldosterone (ACE, ARB), betablockers, CCB, digoxin, diuretics 
- Surgical
	- Catherization and PCI if with MI
	- Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with pacemaker
	- Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) - when EF<35%, high risk for arrhythmia
- Lifestyle
	- Diet - low sodium (2g or less), low fluid (2L), no OTC meds, no packaged food
- Nursing
	- elevate legs or use stockings
	- falls precautions
	- daily weights
	- sex - abstain unless able to climb 2 flights of stairs with no SOB

#### **Diagnostic**
- B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP): measures protein in blood, indicates heart failure #bnp
- Echocardiogram - calculate EF, reveal structural defects
- CXR - r/o pulmonary congestion, cardiomegaly
- ECG
- MRI
- stress test
- Right Heart Catherization - assess pressures
- Farmingham Diagnostic Criteria for HF: acute pulmonary edema, JVD, PND/orthopnea, S3, rales, diuretic response, imaging
