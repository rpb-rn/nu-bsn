### CAD (including MI's)

#nursing #medsurg #cardiovascular #mi
##### **What is it**
- broad term involving arteries in heart leading to:
	- **Chronic Stable Angina** - predictable chest pain during exertion, resolves with rest or nitroglycerin, can progress to unstable
		- ECG: Normal at rest; ST depression or T wave inversion during stress
		- Cardiac Biomarkers: normal
		- Treatment: Lifestyle changes, nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, statins
	- **Acute Coronary Syndromes** (ACS)
		- sudden, life-threatening condition caused by a sudden reduction in blood flow to the heart
		- umbrella term for unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI
			- **STEMI** - ischemia causing **full-thickness** myocardial infarction
				- cardiac biomarkers: elevated troponin, CK-MB
				- Treatment: Emergency PCI or thrombolysis, MONA (morphine, oxygen, nitrates, aspirin).
			- **NSTEMI** - ischemia with myocardial infarction but **without full-thickness injury**
				- caused by-  spasm of artery, stable plaque, a cardiac embolism, or arteritis and injury to the heart
				- similar to UA but more severe and prolonged, unrelieved by rest or nitroglycerin
				- Cardiac Biomarkers: Elevated (troponin, CK-MB).
				- Treatment: Same as UA with emphasis on revascularization (PCI).
			- **Unstable Angina (UA)**-  ischemia without myocardial infarction, cardiac markers are NOT elevated.
				- Occurs at rest, increasing frequency/severity, lasts >20 minutes, unrelieved by nitroglycerin.
				- Treatment: Antiplatelets (aspirin), anticoagulants, beta-blockers, nitrates, PCI if high risk.

Terms to note:
Infarction - tissue death or necrosis caused by prolonged lack of blood supply
Ischemia - reduced cardiac tissue perfusion, can progress to infarction if unresolved

##### **Causes**
- Atherosclerosis - plaques that narrow or occlude blood flow to coronary arteries, decreasing perfusion
- oxygen and nutrient demand outpace supply then causes pain
- hypertension, having a sedentary lifestyle, using tobacco or smoking, and by having insulin resistance or diabetes
- Non modifiable Risk Factors: Age (45 men, 55 women), Sex, Family history/genetics, race/ethnicity (higher w non-Hispanic white individuals)
- Modifiable risk factors: inactivity, poor sleep, vaping/tobacco, obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, stress
- Comorbidities: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, thyroid disease, dm, depression, obesity, gout, cancer

##### **Clinical Manifestations**
- Chest discomfort or angina (only when demand is greater than supply)
- pain can radiate to the left arm, the neck, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">jaw</mark>, or back
- diaphoresis, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, SOB, lightheadedness, and weakness
- females may not experience chest pain (may present with extreme fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, and pressure in the chest)

##### **Diagnostic**
- Cardiac Biomarkers - detect heart muscle damage
	- Troponin - protein found in heart muscle, detects myocardial injury, elevated in NSTEMI, STEMI
		- peaks in 24-48 hours
	- Creatine Kinase-MB - elevated; enzyme found in the heart muscle, indicates MI
	- B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) - Primarily used to r/o HF and assess the severity of volume overload or cardiac stress.
- C-Reactive Protein (CRP)- Measures inflammation levels; Non-specific, but often elevated in CAD & ACS
- Lipoprotein - LDL, HDL
- Stress Test 
	- evaluate how well the heart functions with activity, diagnose CAD and arrhythmias, evaluate treatment, and determine the risk of having an MI
	- Exercise Stress Test - exercises on a treadmill or bicycle, with increasing intensity. HR, BP, and EKG are monitored during the test.
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">stop stress test once chest pain is present</mark>
	- Stress Test Echocardiogram - same as exercise but with echo (U/S)
	- Nuclear Stress Test - radioactive dye is used during stress test

##### **Treatment**
- Initial management: MONA (morphine, aspirin, nitro, O2)
- **STEMI**
	- Cardiac Catherization / Coronary Angiogram - diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure; insertion of catheter into a blood vessel
		- visualize the coronary arteries using contrast dye and X-ray imaging to identify blockages, narrowing, or other abnormalities
		- used to plan angioplasty, stent placement, or other revascularization procedures.
	- **PCI** - non-surgical procedure to treat coronary artery blockages and restore blood flow to the heart
		- aka Angioplasty
		-<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> within 90 minutes, if not: fibrinolysis within 120 minutes</mark>
		- catheter through the skin (usually via the groin or wrist) and threading it to the coronary arteries to open up blockages
		- balloon angioplasty, stent placement, atherectomy
	- CABG - coronary artery bypass graft
	- dual antiplatelet therapy (**DAPT**) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel)
		- not first line therapy, must be given 6-9 hours
- **NSTEMI / UA**
	- more conservative treatment, depends on severity
	- DAPT/anticoags, betablockers
		- heparin does not dissolve clots, only prevents it
		- 
	- post catherization: absent pedal pulses may be present 4-12 hours


##### **Nursing Considerations**
- chest pain = EKG, lab draw
	- ST is LOW = O2 is low
	- ST is HIGH = muscles have died
- elevated troponin = 150-300 mg aspirin, IV heparin
	- antiplatelet therapy with either ticagrelor or clopidogrel taken by mouth
