### Blood Clots
#bloodclot
###### **What is it**
- Blood clots are made up of platelets and fibrin and are a gel-like consistency
- thrombus - when blocks vein or artery
	- arterial thrombosis - occurs in artery
	- venous
- Embolus/embolism - if it moves throughout the body; can cause serious harm

Subtypes
- Pulmonary Embolism
- Myocardial Infarction (MI)
- Ischemic Stroke - occurs in artery to the brain caused by plaque (fatty deposits)
- Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
###### **Clinical Presentation**
- chest pain that worsens with deep breathing
- tachycardia, SOB, lightheadedness, hemoptysis
- MI: chest pain radiating left arm, SOB, diaphoresis
- Stroke: facial weakness, difficulty speaking, visual deficit, L/R sided weakness, seizures
###### **Treatment**
- Thrombolytics - class of meds that dissolve clots
	- Tissue Plasminogen Activator - give within 3 hours for stroke, do not use with hemorrhagic stroke, verify with CT
- Thrombectomy - specialized instruments to surgically remove a blood clot
- Prevention:
	- Coumadin/Warfarin - avoid diet changes, monitor INR, high K diet contradicts this medication
	- Factor Xa Inhibitors - Eliquis, monitoring not required, oral
	- Lovenox/Enoxaparin
	- Heparin - Hold heparin if the platelet count is less than 100,000/mm, monitor aPTT
	- Plavix/Clopidogrel
	- Antiplatelets - ensures platelets do not stick together
		- most common: aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), usually prescribed with ACS
###### **Nursing Interventions**
- ambulate
- diet
- note aging adults challenges
- be on alert with anticoagulants #anticoagulant
	- higher risk for bleeding
	- Warfarin - needs INR, diet restrictions
###### **Causes**
###### **Risk Factors**
- injury or damage to vein
- surgery exacerbated by bed rest
- hormonal: oral contraceptives, pregnancy, hormone replacement, estrogen (menopause, prostate cancer)
- child birth after first 3 months
- smoking
- cancers: lungs, brain, pancreas, uterus, ovaries, blood cancers, chemotherapy
- family history
- Atrial Fibrillation
- Infection
- mechanical heart valves
- SSC - systemic sclerosis, aka "scleroderma": also provides increased risk for clots
###### Diagnosis
- D-dimer test: blood test, high = clot. can also be present during pregnancy or postop
	- small fragment of protein is detected from blood clot
	- not definitive, more testing needed if positive
- CT, US, MRA (magnetic resonance angiography)
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">MRA</mark> = more specific to blood vessels
- V/Q scan - ventilation/perfusion test aided by radioactive and imaging techniques
###### **Systemic Effects**
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) - profoundly serious health condition
	- clotting and anticlotting mechanisms occur at the same time
### DVT
###### **What is it**
- type of blood clot that forms in large veins of extremities or pelvis
- usually occurs in lower extremities
- 3rd most common cause of death among cardiovascular disorders
- DVT will go unnoticed but can dislodge and result in a pulmonary embolus, a life-threatening event
- Types:
	- provoked: from an acquired cause (obesity, cancer, immobility)
	- unprovoked: from an endogenous cause such as recurrence
	- Proximal: above the knee, and this type is more likely to cause complications leading to PE
	- Distal: below the knee (most common)
###### **Clinical Presentation**
- pain, redness, swelling, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">warmth at affected extremity</mark>
- edema
###### **Treatment**
- no longer recommended: DVT filters on inferior vena cava
- Prophylaxis: SCD, Xa inhibitors (Eliquis, newer class)
###### **Nursing Interventions**
- ambulate early
- anticoags
- administer Lovenox - low molecular weight heparin injection
- conduct "wells criteria test" - establish DVT risk
###### Diagnostic Tools
- venous doppler - detects bloow flow
- venography - invasive procedure involving contrast dye and xray
- d-dimer
- MRI
###### **Causes**
- caused by damage to the wall of a blood vessel
- turbulence to blood flow, such as with atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia
- hypercoagulability, meaning the blood is increasingly coagulating or clotting
- decreased blood flow due to immobility, surgery, catheter
- dehydration due to increased blood viscocity
- genetics - factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation
- CHF, COPD
- hospital stay
###### **Risk Factors**
- immobility: bedrest, airplane right, anesthesia
- hormonal: pregnant, contraceptive therapy or hormone replacement therapy with estrogen
- smoking
- family hx, previous hx
- old age
- tumors
- sepsis
- chronic health conditions: HTN, DM
- Usual comorbidities: cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, eczema, vasculitis, cancer, CHF, IBS
- obesity: pressure on the lower extremities
- SSC
###### **Systemic Effects**
- DVT can dislodge and travel = becomes a PE

###### **Complications**
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) - profoundly serious health condition
	- clotting and anticlotting mechanisms occur at the same time.
- hypovolemic shock

### Hemorrhage
###### **What is it**
- Hemorrhage: Loss of blood from damaged vessels, inside or outside the body.
- Severity impacts treatment and prognosis.
- Blood loss classess:
	- Class I - 0-15%
	- Class II - 15-30% (shock symptoms apparent)
	- Class III - 30-40% (delayed cap refill, SBP<90, tachy)
	- Class IV - 40% or more, no UOP, peripheral pulses absent, shock

Types of Hemorrhages:
- Intracranial - brain bleeds
- Pulmonary - hemothorax; caused by trauma, cancer, or clotting
- Stroke - hemorrhagic; vessels rupture and blood leaks into brain
###### **Clinical Presentation**
- Symptoms vary: nausea, dizziness, cool skin, shortness of breath, weakness, tachycardia, confusion.
- Internal bleeding signs: hemoptysis, hematemesis, clammy skin, abdominal rigidity, altered consciousness.
- intracranial hemorrhage: #stroke
	- headaches, slurred speech or difficulty speaking, facial numbness, upper and lower extremity weakness or numbness, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, or difficulty with ambulating
###### **Treatment**
- IV fluids, blood transfusion, oxygen therapy, warming blankets, emotional support.
- Type and cross-match for blood products.
- Physical and occupational therapy for rehabilitation.
###### **Nursing Interventions**
- Goal: stop the bleed
- Assess and identify bleeding source, apply pressure, ensure IV access, administer fluids.
- Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and mental status.
- Educate on gradual activity increase and rest.

MAP > 65 mm Hg indicates adequate cardiac perfusion.
MAP = (DBPÃ—2) + SBP /3
###### Diagnostic Tools
- CBC, platelet count, PT, PTT.
- CT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds
- endoscopy for suspected GI bleeds.
###### **Causes**
- Traumatic injuries, cancer, clotting disorders, elevated BP leading to ruptured aneurysm.
###### **Risk Factors**
- Trauma, accidents, cancer
- blood clotting disorders: hemophillia (genetic mutation)
- poor people = higher risk
- postpartum hemorrhage = atony (flaccid fetus due to significant blood loss during childbirth or postpartum period)
###### **Systemic Effects**
- Hypovolemic shock: decreased cardiac output, circulatory insufficiency, hypoxemia.
- Cognitive impairments, fatigue, depression, anxiety, PTSD.
- Orthostatic hypotension increases fall risk.

### Anemia
#anemia 
###### **What is it**
- abnormally low RBC, Hgb concentration, or HCT
- indicator of underlying disease or disorder
- results in diminished o2 carrying capacity and delivery to tissues and organs
###### **Clinical Presentation**
- Little to no manifestations in mild cases
- Pallor
- Fatigue, somnolence, and headache
- Irritability
- Numbness and tingling of extremities (paresthesia)
- Dyspnea on exertion
- Sensitivity to cold
- Pain and hypoxia with sickle-cell crisis
- SOB, tachy, dizziness
- nail deformities when chronic
###### **Treatment**
- goal of treatment is to restore and maintain adequate tissue oxygenation
- Iron Supplements: oral, IV for severe cases
- Erythropoietin: epoetin alfa - ematopoietic growth factor used to increase production of RBCs
	- monitor for increased BP, monitor CBC, monitor for cardiac event
- B12 supplements - to convert folic acid
	- administer parenterally if lack of intrinsic factors/stomach malabsorption
- Folic Acid Supplements
- Blood Transfusions - for severe only due to risk of infections
###### Nursing Consideration
- Prevention:
- pregnant/menstruating = ensure more iron foods, iron supplements
- iron-deficient and have elevated cholesterol levels => eat more iron-rich foods that are not red or organ meats into their diets
- eat more folate (spinach, lentils, bananas) and folic acid fortified grains and juices
###### Diagnostic Tools
- CBC #cbc
	- Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): Size of red blood cells 
		- Normocytic: Normal size
		- Microcytic: Small cells 
		- Macrocytic: Large cells
	- Mean corpuscular Hgb (MCH): Determines the amount of Hgb per RBC 
	- Mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC): Indicates percentage of Hgb present relative to the size of the cell
- Iron Studies
	- Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) - an indirect measurement of all proteins that bind with iron and transports it for storage
- Sickle cell
- Schilling Test - measure B12 absorption for G6PD
###### **Causes**
- blood loss
- Inadequate RBC production (hypoproliferative)
- Increased RBC destruction (hemolytic)
- Deficiency of necessary components (folic acid, iron, erythropoietin, vitamin B12)
###### **Risk Factors**
- acute or chronic blood loss (trauma, menorrhagia, GI, chemical or radiation exposure)
- rapid metabolic activity: pregnancy, adolescence, infection
- Increased hemolysis:
	- Sickle Cell
	- Impaired Glycolysis: G6PD deficiency anemia
	- Immune Disorders
	- Trauma to RBCs: mechanical heart valve, cardiopulmonary bypass
- Diet or malabsorption: iron, folic acid
	- Pernicious Anemia -  deficiency of intrinsic factor produced by gastric mucosa, which is necessary for absorption of vitamin B12
	- Pica - persistent eating of substances not normally considered food (nonnutritive substances), such as soil or chalk
- Bone Marrow Suppression - exposure to radiation or chemicals
	- Aplastic anemia - results in fewer RBCs as well as decreased platelets and WBC
- Age - Older adult clients are at risk for nutrition-deficient anemias
	- can be misdiagnosed as depression
###### **Systemic Effects**

###### **Complications**
- heart failure due to increased heart demand
### Vitamin Deficiency Anemia (including Pernicious Anemia)
###### **What is it**
- results from fewer healthy RBCs due to the bodyâ€™s low vitamin B12 and folate levels
	- B12 is essential for DNA synthesis in production of RBCs = results in immature, large cells
- absorption (lack of intrinsic factor) or diet problem
###### **Clinical Presentation**
- same as iron deficiency anemia
###### **Treatment**
- B12 - injection, nasap spray, oral
- diet changes to include red meat, chicken, fish, milk
###### **Nursing Interventions**
- note safety issue due to periheral neuropathy: ADLs cannot be done
- visual problems = risk of falls
###### Diagnostic Tools
- CBC with peripheral smear
- B12 and folate serum
###### **Causes**
- autoimmune: Pernicious Anemia (terminal ileum cannot absorb B12) #pernicious
- malabsorption - lack of intrinsic factor
- disease - celiac or Crohn's
- nutritional deficits: vegan diet
###### **Risk Factors**
- antiseizure meds: reduces B12 absorbton
- gastric surgery
- alcohol consumption
- DM meds
- PPI
- contraceptives
- old age
- celiac/Crohn's
- Sjorgen's Syndrome - dry mucous membranes, including dry mouth and eyes.
###### **Systemic Effects**
- newborns: developmental delay, spine/brain defects
- dementia
- mood changes, pysch
- neuropathy, ataxia
### Sickle Cell Anemia
###### **What is it**
- affects the shape of the red blood cells in the body by causing hemoglobin to be sticky
- cause tissues in the body to become hypoxic, leading to many complications
- sickle-shaped RBCs flowing through the blood vessels of the clientâ€™s abdomen, chest, and joints cause severe pain, which can last for hours or days
###### **Clinical Presentation**
- severe pain - affects ADLs, damage to joints
	- can cause anxiety, depression, stress, sleep disorder, poor coping
- fatigue caused by anemia (sickle cells die within 10-20 days, normal life span is 120 days)
- swelling of hands and feet
- visual deficits (sickle cells block vessels in eyes)
- anemia symptoms
- Acute Chest Syndrome - emergency
###### **Treatment**
- pain management
- IV fluids for hydration
- blood transfusion
- Hydroxyurea - reactivates production of fetal hemoglobin
- prevention:
	- drink 8 glasses water daily to prevent dehydration (dehydration = crisis)
	- avoid extreme temp changes
	- avoid high altitudes affecting O2 intake
###### **Nursing Interventions**
- lookout for iron overload arising from frequent blood transfusions
	- iron deposits in organs = organ damage
	- needs iron chelation therapy
- encourage support group
###### Diagnostic Tools
- newborn screening - serum test
- Hemoglobin electrophoresis to identify the type of hemoglobin.
- Complete blood count (CBC) showing anemia and high reticulocyte count.
- Peripheral blood smear showing sickled cells.
###### **Causes**
- both parents must be carriers of the sickle cell trait for the child to be affected
	- if only one parent is carrier, child will be carrier only
###### **Risk Factors**
- genetics
###### **Complications**
- stroke
- blindness
- blood clots during pregnancy and hypertension
- acute chest syndrome - most serious
	- blood flow can be blocked to the lungs, causing breathing difficulty, fever, and severe chest pain
	- emergency!
- Damage to organs, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcerations due to poor circulation, blindness, priapism, DVT, and gallstones are all diseases or disorders that can occur in clients who have sickle cell anemia.
