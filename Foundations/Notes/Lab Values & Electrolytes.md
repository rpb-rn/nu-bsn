**ABG**
- **pH:**  
	- Normal Range: 7.35 - 7.45
	- pH below 7.35 indicates acidosis, and above 7.45 indicates alkalosis.
- **Carbon Dioxide (PaCO₂)**:
	- Normal Range: 35 - 45 mmHg
	- Levels above 45 mmHg suggest respiratory acidosis, while values below 35 mmHg indicate respiratory alkalosis.
- **Bicarbonate (HCO₃):**  
	- Normal Range: ==22 - 26== mEq/L (==people experiment with being "bi" when they are 22-26 years old==)
	- Low HCO₃ levels suggest metabolic acidosis, and high levels suggest metabolic alkalosis.
- **Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PaO₂):**  
	- Normal Range: 80 - 100 mmHg
	- below 60 mmHg indicate hypoxemia and may require oxygen supplementation.

**Electrolyte Values** 
- Sodium: 136 to 145 mEq/L (when your systolic is 136-145, you need to lower your sodium!)
- Calcium: 9 to 10.5 mg/dL (call 9-11 if break your bones: calcium 911)
- Potassium: 3.5 to 5 mEq/L (when you're old as fuck 35-50, you need more potassium)
- Magnesium: 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/L (magnums are between 1-2 inches long)
- Chloride: 98 to 106 mEq/L (a heated swimming pool is 98-106, pool = chlorine)
- Phosphorus: 3 to 4.5 mg/dL (we eat PHO between 3-4:30 PM)
