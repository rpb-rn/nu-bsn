### **Procedures**
- Enema: left side, insert 3-4 inches (2-3 for peds), raise 12-18 inches above anus, lubricate 2 inches
- Physiotherapy for lower lobe atelectasis: place client in Trendelenburg
- IM Injection site:  
- Eyedrops: administration: administer on conjunctival sac (not directly on eye)
- Tracheostomy care at HOME for caregivers
	- clean technique is okay
- Tracheostomy care 
	- hydrogen peroxide for cleaning inner canula, pipe cleaners or brush to remove crusties
		- do not use on SKIN (must be diluted if used on skin)
	- no cotton balls
	- 80-120mmHg suction pressure for adults, 50-100mmHg peds
- Catheter: Male Indwelling
	- secure on upper thigh or lower abdomen with tape/securement device
- Collecting culture from wounds
	- irrigate with NS prior to collecting
	- rotate swab back and forth at base of wound to collect pathogens (NOT EDGES of wound)


Enema Types
- Cleansing enema - removes feces stimulates peristalsis treats constipation or pre-procedure bowel prep.  
- Retention enema - retains solution for prolonged periods for medication absorption or softening stool.  
- Oil retention enema - softens stool lubricates rectum for easier defecation.  
- Medicated enema - delivers drugs for local or systemic effects such as antibiotics or steroids.  
- Carminative enema - relieves gas by stimulating peristalsis and expelling flatus.  
- Return-flow enema - relieves gas by repeated instillation and removal of fluid to stimulate peristalsis.  
- Hypertonic enema - draws water into the colon by osmosis for rapid evacuation.  
- Isotonic enema - saline solution mimics body fluids to soften stool and stimulate evacuation.  
- Soap suds enema - irritates mucosa and stimulates peristalsis using soapy water.

### **Nursing General**
- Braden Scale: parameters are nutrition, sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, friction and shear
- NG Tube Feeding - flush with 30 mL after feeding
- Wound Care
	- Hydrocolloid - best for wounds with minimal/moderate drainage, stage 2 pressure injury
	- Alginate - for heavy exudate, nonadherent dressings that conform to the wound’s shape and absorb exudate
- TPN (nutrition thru IV) - check blood glucose q4, change tubing q24, D10/D20 if nutrition unavailable, check weight daily
- Oxygen At Home: do not wear cotton to limit buildup of static (ATI book says cotton is encouraged)
- Vest Restraint: tie with quick release knot, allow TWO fingerbreadths between restraints and body, apply restraints over clothing
- Purpose of log rolling: protect the spine

#### **Precautions**
**Contact precautions: Think "MRS. WEE"** - chatgpt came up with this. just double check if its accurate.
    M = Multidrug-resistant organisms (e.g., MRSA, VRE)
    R = Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
    S = Skin infections (e.g., scabies, impetigo)
    W = Wound infections
    E = Enteric infections (e.g., C. difficile)
    E = Eye infections (e.g., conjunctivitis)
**Droplet precautions: "SPIDERMAN"**
    S = Streptococcal pharyngitis
    P = Pertussis
    I = Influenza
    D = Diphtheria (pharyngeal)
    E = Epiglottitis
    R = Rubella
    M = Mumps
    A = Adenovirus
    N = Neisseria meningitidis
**Airborne precautions: "MTV"** - this is accurate. if you can only remember one thing, its the airborne
    M = Measles
    T = Tuberculosis
    V = Varicella (chickenpox, shingles)
### Standard Conversion Factors

- 1 mg = 1,000 mcg
- 1 g = 1,000 mg
- 1 kg = 1,000 g
- 1 oz = 30 mL
- 1 L = 1,000 mL
- 1 tsp = 5 mL
- 1 tbsp = 15 mL
- 1 tbsp = 3 tsp
- 1 kg = 2.2 lb
- 1 gr = 60 mg (grain)

**Volume for Medications:**
- 1 tablespoon (tbsp) = 3 teaspoons (tsp)
- 1 ounce (oz) = 30 milliliters (mL)
- 1 pint (pt) = 16 fluid ounces (fl oz) = 480 mL
- 1 quart (qt) = 2 pints = 960 mL
- 1 gallon = 4 quarts = 3.785 liters
- 1 gallon = 8 pints
**Fluid Ounces and Milliliters:**
- 1 fluid ounce (fl oz) = 29.5735 mL


**Erikson's Developmental Stages**
1. **Trust vs. Mistrust**: Infancy (0-1 year) - Developing trust when caregivers provide reliability, care, and affection; lack leads to mistrust.  
2. **Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt**: Early Childhood (1-3 years) - Building autonomy by making choices and gaining control; over-criticism can result in shame and doubt.  
3. **Initiative vs. Guilt**: Preschool (3-6 years) - Encouraging initiative and decision-making; overcontrol can lead to guilt.  
4. **Industry vs. Inferiority:** School Age (6-12 years) - Developing competence through learning and achievement; failure results in feelings of inferiority.  
5. **Identity vs. Role Confusion**: Adolescence (12-18 years) - Forming a strong sense of self and personal identity; failure leads to confusion about one’s role in life.  
6. **Intimacy vs. Isolation**: Young Adulthood (18-40 years) - Establishing meaningful, intimate relationships; failure can lead to isolation and loneliness.  
7. **Generativity vs. Stagnation**: Middle Adulthood (40-65 years) - Contributing to society and supporting the next generation; lack of this results in stagnation.  
8. **Integrity vs. Despair:** Late Adulthood (65+ years) - Reflecting on life with a sense of fulfillment and acceptance; failure leads to regret and despair.

1 lb of body = 3500 calories (having calorie excess of 500cal/day would mean 10 lbs gain within 10 weeks)

Iatrogenic HAI - caused from diagnostic or therapeutic procedures

Glaucoma - optic nerve damage caused by pressure (IOP, intraocular pressure). Pressure is caused by obstructed flow of vitreous humor. 


Patient Movement
- transferring patient from bed to wheel chair: place wheelchair 45 degree angle to bed, stand on client weaker side
