neurons =&gt; brain tissue n shit
Neurotransmitters - key and lock system (neurotransmitter: key; receptor site: lock); then they are either: Reuptake: neurotransmitter is stored for reuse or broken down
Inactivated =&gt; prevents continuous stimulation of receptors (Acetylcholinesterase, Monoamine Oxidases, Catechol-O-Methyltransferase) see =&gt; <a data-href="Neurotransmitters" href="psych/ii.-relationship-building/neurotransmitters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Neurotransmitters</a>Genetics
mental illnesss can be inheritable
Neurobiology - functioning of bran impacts behavior
example: twins with separate living environment can develop mental illness, addiction is passed down from parent to child
Psychiatric Pharmacogenomic Testing
study that seeks to understand how the genetics of an individual may impact the interaction on psychotropic mediccations
can show severity of side effects
Psychoimmunology
studies impact of psychosocial stress on the body’s immune system
relationship between stress and the immune system may be related to the presentation of some manifestations of mental illness
Infection =&gt; viral infection possibly alters genetic composition in the central nervous system leading to the presentation of mental illnessNeuroplasticity
brain’s ability to adapt synaptic connections, particularly in response to stress or learning or after experiencing an injury
ability to establish new neuronal pathways or go through complete neuronal remapping in response to a stimulus
may take weeks or months to reconfigure pathways
Explains why: some manifestations of mental illness increase in severity over time, such as Major Depressive Disorder, and cannot be cured through a single dose of medication
Explains why: pysch meds take weeks to take effect

too much serotonin
causes: too much SSRI, migrain/pain meds, LSD, ecstasy, combining antidepressants with St. John's wort
Manifestations: restlessness, high BP, tachycardia, dilated pupils, muscle rigidity, sweating, loss of muscle coordinator
Treatment: sedate with benzodiazepines, serotonin antagonist medications like cyproheptadine.
Activation Syndrome
can potentially happen when starting SSRI
manifestations of irritability, anxiety, impulsivity, aggressiveness, and agitation
High risk for suicidal ideations
may develop within the first few hours of administration through the first few weeks
Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome
sudden discontinuation of the antidepressant medication
difficulty sleeping, anxiety, depression, and flu-like symptoms
rare: electric-shock-like sensations felt in their heads that can disrupt ADLs
stopping MAOIs - psychosis
may persist for weeks
Lithium Toxicity
anything greater than 1.5 mEq/L
<br>Causes: dehydration, overdose, concurrent use with Loop <a data-href="Diuretics" href="pharmacology/cardiovascular/diuretics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diuretics</a>
Manifestations: Early Toxicity 1.5 mEq/L poor coordination, confusion, and sedation
GI discomfort, nausea, coarse tremors, vomiting, and diarrhea
Treatment: withhold, consult provider Advanced =&gt; 2.0-2.5 seizures and stupor

effect of blocking dopamine transmission from the midbrain to the brainstem.
Types: Akathisia: Restlessness, pacing, fidgeting
Dystonia: Muscle stiffness, spasms, locked gaze
Parkinsonism: Tremors, rigidity, slow movements, slumped posture, shuffling gait, drooling, tremors, and pill-rolling movements of the fingers
Tardive dyskinesia: Involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and limbs Treatment: anticholinergic =&gt; diphenhydramine, benzotropine; or valbenazine Usually: B52 - benadryl, haldol, ativan Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is an evidence-based assessment of the level of tardive dyskinesia based on abnormal movement.

Foundational Concepts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Historical Perspective
increased need for psych services after WWII
National Mental Health Act of 1946 - Truman, establishment of National Institute of Mental Health
1950s - use of pharm, chlorpromazine for aggression &amp; psychosis
1960s - JFK Mental Retardation Facilities, Community Mental Health Center Constructions act
Contemporary Perspective
use of asylums
movement that limits institutionalization - focus on community-based care
Healthy People 2030 - focus on multiple aspects of care - prevention, screening - goal =&gt; improve quality of life for those with mental illness
Increase in primary Care
Mental Health - the foundation for emotions, thinking, communication, learning, resilience, and self-esteem. Ability to complete ADLMental Illness - health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior (or a combination of these). Mental illnesses are associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work, or family activities." Mental Health Disorder - a diagnostic term for a group of mental illness manifestations.Mental Health Continuum - range of mental health functioning with adaptive (wellness, health coping) on one end of the spectrum and maladaptive (illness, unhealthy coping, or an inability to cope) on the other end of the spectrum.
Excelling - highest level of well being, in that a person has fulfillment in life and the ability for personal success. Motivations for goal achievement, rational thoughts, ability to foster social relationships, and the ability to resolve stress.
Thriving - may experience stressors but can resolve those stressors. The nurse should look for plans or actions to process stress and the ability to foster social activity. Surviving - not a state of distress, but it is a state in which problems that may need action can be recognized. It may be described as the person feeling on edge. The nurse should look for nervousness, irritability, distraction, or withdrawnness.
Struggling - may feel worthlessness, worried often, and that life is misery, but not all hope is lost. The nurse should look for poor performance in academic or occupational settings and dysfunctions in sleep and appetite.
Crisis - severe symptoms and needs assistance. The nurse should anticipate a high level of worry, low mood, dysfunction in sleep, and irrational thinking.
Continuum of Care (Wellness-Illness Model) - views an individual’s mental health across three general areas, well-being, neutrality, and disability
Well Being - healthy
Neutrality - ability to learn is diminished, no manifestation of illness, able to function, complete ADL
Disability - mental illness, difficulty functioning
Diathesis-Stress Model - two part theory, explains mental how mental illness develops
Diathesis - individual's genetic or biological predisposition for developing an illness (family hx)
Stress - change in environment (physical or emotional) =&gt; infection, job change, etc
Social Determinants of Health - direct impact on well being; psychological distress are caused by a multitude of factors, such as discrimination, prejudice, and exposure to violence experienced by individuals based on their age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, or ethnicity.5 Main Groups of SODH
Life course - exposure to physical, environmental, and socioeconomic events at critical stages throughout one’s life Most critical stage: where rapid growth and neurological development typically occur
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) = Traumatic or negative events such as physical or emotional abuse and neglect, sexual abuse, and a dysfunctional homelife that increase the risk for depression, anxiety, behavior, and substance use disorders.
Protective Factors: social support systems, health screenings, and mental health resources, Households - Income, access to resources like food and water, parental mental and physical health, social support, and maternal care Lack of insurance coverage - huge factor in decrease seeking care Community - built and natural environment, neighborhood security, and the degree to which individuals participate in community events.
Local services - schools, social services, health-related services, family services, age-related services (youth and older adults), and access to clean air and water. Country-level factors - human rights, access to health care, housing needs, policies for education access, governance, and inequality. Poverty = children who are poor have higher risk
Pollution
Disasters, war
Protective Factors: national policies, cyberbullying, etc Delay in seeking health - cased by stigma, bias
Stigma negative attitude or discredit against an individual or an identifiable group in which the individual or group is labeled as being different. can be thru media -&gt; public stigma employer can negative attitude toward mental illness unemployment rate of people with M.I. - higher 3 Types of Stigma Public - negative attitude toward those who have a mental illness; this can be expressed in discriminatory attitudes or actions.
Self-Stigma - negative view or internalized shame regarding their condition.
Institutional - governmental policies or organizations limit opportunities for those with mental illness; this can be both intentional and unintentional. Bias
stigma leads to bias
stereotypes, prejudice, or even discrimination against a group of people that, in comparison to another group, is unfair
example of stereotype: depression = desire to self-harm, attention seeking
Explicit Bias - Intentionally displaying behaviors of discrimination toward someone.
Implicit Bias - bias occurs outside of one’s conscious awareness.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) principal diagnostic tool for defining and diagnosing mental health conditions.
Conditions are continuously monitored and can be graded based on severity and absence or presence of certain features.
Does not include treatment!
tool to assist providers in using common diagnostic language to describe clients with mental health disorder
WHO International Classification of Disease (ICD) - coding system utilized by member nations of the WHO to provide a common language around the description of illnesses.DSM5 - includes criteria for diagnosis
lack of health insurance =&gt; leads to decrease in seeking care for M.I. clients have the right to humane treatment - consent and confidentiality, refuse treatment
JAB-FN =&gt; Just Always Be Fair &amp; Nice
=&gt; Justice, Autonomy, Beneficience, Fidelity, NonmaleficenceNursing Code of Ethics: Ethical Principals
Beneficence - providers act for doing good, and preventing harm
Autonomy - ability to make rational decisions related to their care.
Nonmaleficence - do no harm
Justice - Fair and equal care and treatment for all Considerations:
balance autonomy and client safety =&gt; can present as ethical dilemmas
nurses may limit choices in order to keep patient safe
Involuntary Hold - admitted against their willRight to self-determination - allows a client to refuse treatment, medzHIPAA - Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act =&gt; need consent to release infoDuty to Warn - healthcare providers responsiblity when another patient threatens another; must reportMistreatment - nurses are required to protect vulnerable individuals, children, elderly, disabled for maltreatment/abuseCultural Humility - practice of trying to appreciate and respect another individual’s culture and the role it plays in the individual’s life and health practicesHolistic Practices - acupuncture, massage therapy, natural erbs, specific diet, etc]]></description><link>psych/i.-foundations/i.-foundational-concepts.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Psych/i.

A psychotherapeutic-based treatment focused on modifying or controlling the immediate environment in which the client is living.
Focus includes social and physical settings with the purpose of promoting health and healing.
more humane care to clients than asylums trauma-informed - most pysch patients have traumatic past reduces inappropriate behavior
milieau = environment
mental health facility should be structured in ways that provide an ongoing therapeutic environment
encourages self-awareness and self- management
basically everything that is good
standard of care for nurses
Components of Milieu:
Physical: healing space =&gt; safe and prevention injury, low stim, privacy, home-like restraints - balance with dignity; least restrictive
promote interactions - chairs must be conversation-like instead of line Psychosocial: creating healing culture implement therapeutic social environment
idea: each client owns their behavior and is responsible for their choices
planned structure - predictability is good
post schedule and client rights on spaces More components of Physical Milieu:
Safety &amp; injury prevention → self/other-directed, suicide risk
Staff observation levels → safety, ongoing assessment
Environmental stimulation → noise, light, interactions
Adjust placement → room/unit changes based on sensitivity or need
Art, color, design → match clinical needs, avoid overstimulation (abstract art → confusion, anxiety, anger, depression)
Provide stimulation → sensory enhancement for dementia clients
Ensure privacy → dedicated spaces
Restraints/seclusion → balance dignity, independence, least restrictive goal
Consider cognition/physical needs → signage, wheelchair/walker accessibility basis for determining intentions, motives, and actions by a particular group or within society.
consideration of cultural norms, personal morals or values, and values of the profession
Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 - protects the rights of patients who have mental illnesses, provides mental health pros with ethical and legal responsibilities for patients
autonomy
nonmaleficence - do not harm
beneficence - removing harmful conditions to benefit the client or others. example: providing meds to reduce agitation, or remove objects that could pose harm fidelity - keeping promises
veracity - Dealing truthfully with clients and others during professional interactions.
justice - speak and be heard in a group session
confidentiality
informed consent
involuntary admission
Code Of Ethics for Nurses - outlined by the American Nurses Association
articulates the ethical values, duties, and standards expected of a nurse in all areas of their practice​​​​​​​. Capacity - ability or inability to make decisions about proposed medical treatments or aspects of their health care.Competence
only determined by a JUDGE thru a court hearing
ability to understand information, use reasonable thought processes, communicate their wishes
can understand the consequences of their decisions.
Parity - equal coverage for mental and physical health in accessibility to health insurance.Federal government:
Regulates health systems and providers.
Protects the rights of the individual.
Provides funding for services.
Supports research and innovation.
Establishes and enforces a minimum standard of mental health care.
State Government:
Establishes specific standards and regulations for mental health treatment.
Provides oversight of mental health care within the state.
Addresses issues related to treatment facilities, medical records, and standards, including involuntary treatment.
Expands on federal government programs, funding, research, and protection standards.
Types of Admission:
Voluntary Admission client requests evaluation or admission to a mental health facility
needs consent form
must be assessed within 72 hours =&gt; then DC or continue admission Involuntary Admission - assisted inpatient treatment. severe mental illness, danger to self and others, unable to meet basic self-care
illness prevents them from recognizing the need to seek care
usually needs 2 providers to submit justification
Emergency Hold: must determine to DC within 72 hours (in most states) =&gt; when without court order
If evaluation determines patient meets criteria for commitment =&gt; court hearing - patient provided legal counsel Emergency Admission - temporary admission imminent danger to themselves or others
usually detained by law enforcement Client Bill of Rights - in place despite being involuntarily admittedExceptions to Confidentiality and Privacy:
danger to themselves
danger to others
leave facility against medical advice
suspicion of abuse (including neglect, battery, murder)
Duty To warn - notify individuals who are being threatened by a client supersedes upholding the client’s right to (Tarasoff)Informed Consent - can apply to legal representative if client is incompetent
description f treatment
benefits, adverse effects
risks
consequence of not receiving treatment
alternatives if available
signed form - if applicable by state
nurse to serve as witness
Implied Consent - can never be used if a patient's legal representative refuses treatmentCapacity vs Competency
Capacity
ability to provide informed consent
often assumed by provider; if needed =&gt; use cognition assessment tool
ability to understand information, use reasonable thought processes
ability to: communicate their wishes, and understand the consequences of their decisions.
Competency
can only be determined in court of law during hearing
health care providers cannot determine this!
cognitive processes are intact and able to make decisions based on their personal motives
if incompetent, a legal surrogate, guardian is assigned
Psychiatric Advanced Directives (PAD)
legal tool that allows patient to outline their wishes prior to a mental health crisis
underutilized - need further education
laws vary by state
Tort
violation of a patient's protected rights; breach of duty of the nurse
intentional or unintentional
Unintentional Tort - one example is negligence (standard of care not provided)
Intentional Tort - examples include assault, battery (e.g. shaking a patient to awaken them), false imprisonment (restraints without lawful reason)
patients should always be supervised during: seclusion/restraint
left in a prone or supine position check q15 minutes
Document always - include who was consulted, what was done, who was notified
False Imprisonment - confinement of a patient when there is no legal reason to do so; use of restraints/seclusionOrder of Interventions (least to most restrictive):
de-escalation
timeout
seclusion
physical/chemical restraint
De-escalation Strategies
Use verbal communication that is clear and calm.
body language of staff is nonthreatening.
Approach the client with respect by being supportive of their issue or concern.
Respond to client issues or concerns creating a sense of trust.
Set clear limits or boundaries.
low-stim environment
Seclusion vs Timeout
Timeout - to separate from a situation, allowing them time to think, calm down, prepare to end the behavior that, and reengage with others with a more composed presence and controlled behaviorSeclusion vs Restraint
next step from timeout
seclusion - last intervention before restraint
Chemical Restraints - associated with increased risk of harm, skin breakdown, falls, deterioration of mental status
last resort (along with physical restraints)!
examples: antipsychoitcs/neuroleptics, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, sedatives
Documentations:
order
patient behavior leading up to
indication that least restrictive/de-escalation techniques were attempted
type of restraints
interventions while restrained
ongoing monitoring every 15 minutes - behavior, circulation, skin check
Debriefing - to improve quality of future responsesPsychiatrist - diagnose medical and psychiatric illnesses, prescribe meds, give treatment orders, provide talk therapy, may specialize in children/adolescents
Psychologist - assess brain function and provide talk therapies
Social Worker/LCSW - create treatment goals, address long-term needs, provide psychotherapy
Occupational Therapist - assess skills and provide rehabilitation
Social Worker - provide social support such as housing, finances, and insurance
Counselor/Therapist - use therapeutic techniques to reduce symptoms (e.g., drama or art therapy)
Psychiatric Pharmacist - manage medications for mental health care
Right to Treatment - right to emergency treatment regardless of their ability to pay
Right to Refuse Treatment provider can deny treatment: risks outweigh benefits
also includes right to second opinion
no surprises act - costs are told upfront Client Bill of Rights:
To be treated with consideration and respectful care.
To make an advance directive and appoint someone to make health care decisions.
To obtain current and understandable information regarding their care, treatment, and potential health outcomes.
To refuse a recommended treatment, including medications.
To privacy and confidentiality, including communication and records.
To be informed of charges and policies.
To review their medical records.
To refuse inclusion in medical research studies.
To receive reasonable continuity of care.
To be informed of business relationships facilities or providers have that may influence care.
When on conservationaship - no right to refuse treatment
OSHA
Workplace Violence - act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening or disruptive behavior
As nurses become more burnt out, compassion takes a plummet

home health care managers - promotes wellness and functioning in a client’s home as a health care setting.
Therapeutic Roles:
using nurse-patient relationship to build trust
help identifying factors that aggravate or alleviate symptoms, coordinating spiritual leaders, encouraging emotional expression, or reinforcing cognitive-behavioral techniques. shorter frequent interactions are BETTER than occasional, longer ones
Phases of Therapeutic Relationship: (Peplau)
Pre-interaction - recognize need of the client, perform self evaluation of own beliefs and behavior before engaging with patient
Orientation - collects data, assesses knowledge, and works with the client to develop mutual goals; inform client of multiple teams working with them =&gt; establish nurse-client relationship, identify barriers to wellness
Working - the nurse and client have established a mutual level of trust and comfort and develop progress toward established goals.
Termination - resolution phase, goals have been met, new goals developed; ensure continuity of care (e.g. community resource referrals)
Boundary blurring - when boundaries become unclear, avoidTransference / Countertransference
Transference - client to redirect their previously-experienced feelings or emotions toward the nurse. "you are leaving me just like my father" Countertransference - unconscious effort on behalf of the nurse to redirect their previously experienced feelings or emotions toward the client. "the client needs something, they never stop"
"they remind me of my grand mother" Nurse must redirect to avoid, if not possible speak to supervisor
Nonverbal Communication
Incongruence - when facial expression doesn't match patient's mood; certain meds can cause this
Therapeutic Communication: body position, body language, eye contact, touch, silence, and intuition
SOLER =&gt; acrnonym for therapeutic nonverbal comms
S - sit squarely to the patient (directly in front = too confrontational, slight angle is good)
O - open posture
L - lean forward
E - eye contact
R - relaxSURETY
Sit at an angle
Uncross arms and legs
Relax
Eye Contact
Touch
Your IntuitionOARS =&gt; therapeutic communication mnemonic
Open-ended
Affirmations =&gt; positive reinforcement, praise
Reflections
Summaries
Open-Ended Statements =&gt; always allow the client to elaborate in their own words
avoid using "would you", "can you" -&gt; use "tell me more" or some shit like that
Reflective Statements:
Simple Reflection - to clarify client emotions or statements - kinda like parroting
Complex Reflection - infers client emotion or thoughts in an effort to portray engagement and clarity.Summaries - restate major key concepts, way to move on to the next phaseBarrier to Therapeutic Communication:
not doing self-evaluation of countertransference and bias
Conducting The Interview:
Socratic Questioning - using a series of open-ended, probing questions to help individuals explore their thoughts
Active Listening
Transtheoretical Model of Change =&gt; tbh not sure if it's worth it to studyLevels of Prevention:
Primary - prevent the onset of disease (vaccines, education, lifestyle changes)
Secondary - catch disease early (screenings, checkups, early detection tests)
Tertiary - reduce the impact and complications of existing diseases
Therapeutic Window - when interventions are most effective; maximize this6 Attributes for Culturally Competent Care:
Awareness
Knowledge
Sensitivity
Skill
Proficiency - recognize lack of knowledge
Dynamicity
Leininger's Transcultural Theory
considers the client’s social, spiritual, psychological, and physiological perspectives
basically a whole-body approach
embrace DEI type of shit
use smart phones to engage patients and family
telehealth
4 Processes to Follow to Utilize MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING
Engage - allows the client to share their perspective on what is important in their life.
Focus - avoid "expert trap" =&gt; prescribing information or advice without the consent, solicitation, or consultation of the client.
Evoke - use client's own motivation to make necessary behavior change
Plan - should be S.M.A.R.T

standardized way to communicate with other nurses in regards to care Questions to ask?
Things to look out for?
Is the patient DTS - danger to self? Yes, but need to ask more questions
"what does anxiety and depression mean to you?"
give benadryl, instead of haldol
takeaway: need to determine trigger 28yo female

Mood or Thought Disorder - thought disorder
Patient becomes increasingly agitated during assessment
yelling, cursing, demanding to leave, destroying property
De-escalate? - yes try it
Hands on? - yes, because she already destroyed property
IMs? intramusculars - yes - faster than PO medz
PRN meds: thorazine for agitation
Ativan anxiety
which would you pick? - none of them, all of them are PO <br> <img style="width:100%;" alt="Escalation cycle infographic" src="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/contentassets/c436658d31b743499d8a2384e97cc25b/escalation-cycle-infographic.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved"> Escalation cycle infographic — Seattle Children’s 25yo male
BIB police from trolley station
acting erratic, attempting to charge officers and was tazed
Day1: receives 3 I'm meds for agitation over the course of 16 hours Day 2: received patient on AM shift
received I'm at 0100 but was not effective, been up since noon the previous day
on assessment: patient is friendly

mood - irritable, labile (low impulse control)
affect: blunted =&gt; positive or negative of schizophrenia? ans: negative
Appearance: disheveled, malodorous
Oriented to name only
"i want to go bacj to where I died last time" Scheduled meds: 20 ng PO zyprexa QHS =&gt; what to think of this dose? PRN: Vistaril 50 mg PO q4h PRN anxiety =&gt; insight: there is no med for agitation
answer: no Patient did not sleep the whole night
appears energetic, walking into toher patients rooms, causing distress to other patients
what other options do we have?
In the end: patient was put in seclusion
given ativan at 1300, patient assualt staff, code called. patient given emergency 5250 (Haldol, Ativan, Benadryl) What changes are expected to see? zyprexa increased to 30mg PO QHS
no PRNs added 45yo male, received on day2
cc: suicidal ideations
detoxing on alcohol, lost his job, financial burdens, descrines self as alcoholic, drinks 6 pack a day
BAC 300, but oriented to name, place, time, situation. Last drink was 0900 yesterday
CIWA - Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol =&gt; maybe every hour 8 below is mild withdrawal, actual score is 4
delirium and tremors = deadly patient complaints of: diarrhea, nausea, sensitivity to light, irritability, runny nose, akathisia (uncontrolled urge to move) actual CIWA score is probably higher Meds: ativan 2mg PO TID, vitamin b 1tab PO daily, abilify 10 mg PO daily
PRN: ativan 2mg PO q2h, CIWA &gt; 8
2 hrs later: patient is complaining of same discomforts. CIWA is now probably higher
Take away: staff is not fond of this patient, but still as a nurse, treat the patient same demographic as previous
use COWS scale
patient is asking for sobuxone, nurse gives it but 2 hours later, patient is complaining of runny nose, diarrhea, tachycardia, N/V. What happened?
takeaway: must wait for all withdrawal symptoms to manifest before giving suboxone =&gt; wait until they have diarrhea
Missle - Haldol
Rocket Launcher - Risperidone
Pistol - Zyprexa (Olanzapine)]]></description><link>psych/class-notes/09-17-case-study-day.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Psych/Class Notes/09-17 Case Study Day.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 19:31:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/contentassets/c436658d31b743499d8a2384e97cc25b/escalation-cycle-infographic.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/contentassets/c436658d31b743499d8a2384e97cc25b/escalation-cycle-infographic.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[09-03 Clinical Orientation]]></title><description><![CDATA[Per Sevilla:

on Case study days, roll call will not start until 1000 5150 - 72 hours, criteriaL DTS (danger to self), DTO (danger to others), GD (Grave Disability - kinda like failure to thrive)
5250 - 14 day hold first opportunity for patient to prove that they do not need to be there
court will see evidence for and against the hold 5350 - 30 day hold only for grave disability
mood stabilizers and antidepressants take 2-3 weeks to work
usually doctors may pursue conservatorship Conservatorship - temporary vs permanentRiese - court hearing to determine if a person has the ability to take their medication
AI definition: A Riese hold is actually a Capacity Hearing, named after the court case Riese v. St. Mary's Hospital (1987), that determines if a patient on a mental health hold in California has the legal capacity to refuse psychiatric medication. If the court finds the patient lacks capacity, the facility can administer medication that the patient would otherwise refuse. This hearing ensures involuntary patients can refuse treatment if they have the mental capacity to make informed decisions about it.

Literature REviews - conclusions derived from comparisons of the results of multiple peer-reviewed studies that were conducted on the same topic.
Qualitative Studies - narrative in nature, as the researchers and the participants discuss or explain their primary reasons, attitudes and motivations”
Quantitative Studies - use numerical data to evaluate outcomes.
Mixed Methods - combine qualitative studies, which explore experiences and quantitative designs, which enumerate findings.
Continuum of Professional Boundaries:
Under-involvement
Therapeutic Relationship/
Over-involvement
MLP = Medical Legal Partnership
interprofessional model working to reduce # of patients with MI related to SDOH
tenet: training, the merging of healthcare and legal services for this cause, and advocacy at the federal and state levels
SMI - Serious Mental Illness =&gt; defined by the degree of dysfunction it may in ADLs
lower life expectancy
usually accompanied by medical comorbidities
lower QOL
goal: improve QOL, manage medical comorbidities
Professional Stigma - care provided to SMI patients is lesser quality d/t stigma
Goal: attend educational sessions, know SMI life experiences, develop relationship
Daily Living Issues =&gt; Housing, Unemployment
inability to get/maintain job
Approaches: Housing First - focus on getting stable living first before getting job
Treatment First - establish job first prior to getting housing Caveat - getting a job means getting disenrolled from medicaid, job makes it difficult to get treatment
Supported Housing - community-based program that provides housing and community-based treatment and support services to assist clients to integrate into the community and live independentlySocial Ecological Model (SE) - Individual, Interpersonal, Organizational, Community and Policy/SystemHarm Reduction Model - recovery as a process and an outcome incorporating abstinence in its treatment for clients who have substance use disorderCommon Treatment Issues:
Medication Adherence Solutions: Mobile Assessment and Treatment for Schizo (MATS) - mobile phone, reminder meds, FOCUS Relapse - use phone apps too to manage
Community Programs:
psychotherapy
medications
assertive community treatment (ACT) involves an interprofessional team of health care workers (nurses, psychiatrists, social workers, and case managers) supporting a client
appropriate for VERY serious patients supported employment
supported housing ADPIE =&gt; per ati: AAPIEAssessment
Analysis
Planning
Implementation
EvaluationAdverse Childhood Experiences
traumatic events
essential to unlocking sources of a client’s condition and disorders later in life
correlation between high risk behavior
Trauma-informed care - approach that allows the client to feel safe because the nurse is actively listening, accepting, and operating within a framework of compassionHolistic Nursing - provides the nurse the opportunity to care for the client as a wholeCommon Issues to deal with Holistic nursing:
dental health
eye health
sexual/reproductive health
cardiovascular health
higher rates of tobacco use
substance use
obesity
Working Alliance - relationship between client and provider or nurse, or other member of the health care team who is foundational to the effectiveness of the client’s care.
recovery is becoming more relevant
Recovery Model
shifting the focus from the management of symptoms to life goals and individualizing services for individual client needs
opposite of medical model: goal is symptom free
promotes increased self-esteem and affirms a positive contribution to society understand that patient will not be symptom free
recovery does not equal COMPLETE independence
Rehabilitation Model
Development of independence: intellectual, spiritual, physical, and psychological
similar to recovery as they promote independence

biological and psychological response to a perceived or experienced stressor
can be positive or maladaptive
survival response - affects a lot of systems
Chronic Stress - repeated exposure, no opportunity for recovery
Categories:
Psychological - loss of self-esteem, grief, fear, cognitive, loss of personal security
Physiological - injury, heat/cold, illness, pain, substance abuse, etcPathophysiology of Stress
amygdala sends "distress call" to hypothalamus, which releases CRH -&gt; pituitary release adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)
Adrenal gland -&gt; cortisol, epinephrine
Fight-or-Flight Response -&gt; can be fight, faint, flight, freeze, fawnGeneral Adaptation Syndrome - GAS
when an event or stressor threatens the body and activates a three-stage response Stages of Gas:
Alarm Stage aka, alarm stage =&gt; Fight-Flight-Freeze-Faint-or-Fawn
initial, brief, and adaptive response
sympathetic nervous system is activated: shock, then counter shock
shock -&gt; decrease in blood pressure, temperature, muscle tone, and a loss of bodily fluid
countershock -&gt; increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity -&gt; "fight response" increased HR, BP RR, heighted cognitive processes, senses, glucose, endurance, decreased digestion (nonessential) Resistance Stage aka adaptation stage =&gt; body attempts to adapt to the stressor
the stressor diminishes, the individual can return to homeostasis Exhaustion Stage body has depleted its resources and can no longer adapt to the stressor
tissues and organs are depleted, and the result can lead to illness, disease, or death Levels of Anxiety
Mild Triggered by stressor
Increased awareness, hypervigilance
peak problem-solving ability
Tension-relieving behaviors: nail-biting, foot-tapping, fidgeting
restlessness Moderate Stress unresolved or perceived strongly
Narrowed perception field, decreased concentration
Limited learning ability, still problem-solves
Sympathetic activation → ↑vitals
Still has ability to learn and practice coping skills Severe Ongoing or threatening stress
Distorted perception, focus on single detail
Minimal problem-solving, feels no solution
Symptoms: somatic complaints, impending doom, withdrawal, loud speech, nausea Panic Unable to process environment
Disorganized, irrational, dissociation
Fight-flight-fawn-faint-freeze responses
Possible hallucinations, delusions
Counterpoint: stress -&gt; depletion of energy and the breakdown of resilience mechanisms -&gt; erosion of health Good stress or bad stress?
research says stress is neither good or bad
Eustress -&gt; positive stress response to a challenging but beneficial task that results in development growth, mastery, or a sense of fulfillment.
Viewing stress as positive - good adaptation
Acute Stress
sudden exposure to adverse stressor
can last for short period or a long time, depending on individual
Chronic Stress
prolonged exposure
can lead to: eating disorders, mood disorders, and substance use disorders, as well as physical diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, and type 2 diabetes. Response to stress:
Acute Stress - ↑ reaction time, ↑ energy, hyperawareness, ↑HR
Chronic Stress - anxiety, ↑ infection, insomnia, depressionToxic Stress
result of a prolonged or chronic stress response system
body learns that experiencing fear, stressors, or trauma is normal
biological and neurological changes to brain and body
example: chronic stress since childhood, chronic neglect, exposure to violence, economic hardship, caregiver substance abuse
referred to as ACEs -&gt; adverse childhood experience
Mediators =&gt; either Individual or EnvironmentalIndividual Factors:
Perceptions &amp; Attitudes hardiness and resilience
lack of control, low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and a sense of hopelessness Temperament &amp; Personality temperament - energy level, emotional responsiveness, demeanor, mood, response tempo, behavioral inhibition, and willingness to explore
personality traits - characteristics drawn from a pattern of behaviors, attitudes, feelings, and habits. Genetics/Neurodevelopment - health condition, gender, prenatal care, age
Lifestyle modifiable habits that can be related to individual choices and patterns of behaviors use of drugs and alcohol, smoking, physical activity, sleep, and eating Personality Traits:
Neuroticism vs. Emotional Stability
Extroversion vs. Introversion
Openness to Experience vs. Closeness to Experiences
Conscientiousness vs. Lack of Direction
Agreeableness vs. AntagonismHardiness -&gt; based on a positive self-perception and attitudes of hopefulnessEnvironmental Factors:
Environment &amp; Setting Safe, secure, and positive school or work environments are considered protective environmental factors
high stress: pollution, abuse, or crime Cultural connection to one's culture is a form of social support, protective factor
cause of stress: adapting to new cultures =&gt; language, discrimination, stereotypes Support System: family &amp; community Safe, supportive, and secure early relationships can help individuals self-regulate
Risk factor: lack of parental support and parent-child bonding
ages of 18 and 23 =&gt; decreased social interactions -&gt; loneliness, stress Spirituality &amp; Religion offer positive influence, feeling of community, develop resilience Coping - learning to adjust to the stress or stressor while trying to keep themselves in a state of mental and physical equilibrium Holmes-Rahe Social Readjustment Scale
measures positive and negative life events and assigns a value to certain stressors
can provide insight into client’s experience of stress and risk for developing an illness
each life event =&gt; assign point
Coping Styles:
Problem-focused - adaptive
Emotion-Focused - adaptive; reduces negative emotions
Avoidant Coping - cognitive and behavioral efforts directed toward diminishing, ignoring, or denying stressful situations in an effort to avoid dealing with the stressor crucial to maintain emotional homeostasis
continuum from adaptive to maladaptive
Adaptive Defense Mechanisms (aka, mature defenses)
do not distort the situation/reality
help accept situation, even if not comfortable
found in individuals with healthy, mature functioning =&gt; aware of the stressor; use stress-management technique
may be conscious or unconscious
Maladaptive Defense Mechanisms
based on avoiding, negating, or distorting reality to provide relief from the stressor
common among individuals whose emotions and impulsivity outperform reasoning
conscious or unconscious effort
often seen in children and may be considered normal for children based on their emotional development
prolong, avoid, or complicate stressors, potentially developing into symptoms of mental illness
Adjusting expectations
Avoids disappointment, reduces stress
Consider multiple outcomes Biofeedback Biosensors monitor physiological responses physical and mental exercises to help control their specific automatic physical body functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature.
Clinician assists with interpretation Goal: awareness + self-regulation Deep breathing
Slow, deliberate breaths improve gas exchange
↓heart rate, ↓BP, relaxation
Refocuses stress, ↑breathing awareness
Types: figure-eight, dragon, square Positive self-talk &amp; reduce self-blame
Encourage kindness, not doubt or blame
Physical + mental health benefits Guided imagery
Deep breathing + imagining calm scene
Engage senses in imagined environment
Guided verbally or via audio Mindfulness meditation
Focus on present moment, thoughts, sensations
Accept without judgment
Recognize feelings, let them go ]]></description><link>psych/iii.-social,-emotional,-behavioral/stress.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Psych/iii.

state of well being, can realize own abilities, cope with normal stress of life, live fruitfully and all that shit
can handle stress of everyday life
as opposed to patient with mental illness - no ability to cope
Mental Health Continuum =&gt; range of mental well-being, with excellent mental health at one end and poor mental health, or mental illness, at the other end.
everyone falls somewhere in the continuum!
5 Zones of Mental Health Continuum =&gt; can fluctuate; not goal-oriented - descriptive only
Excelling - peak, top performance; e.g. marriage, promotion
Thriving - can cope with regular stress, no long-term concerns; normal level performance
Surviving - increased stress &amp; disruption, high risk of regressing =&gt; must practice coping mechanisms
Struggling - anxiety, depression, poor concentration, struggling with work; need professional help in managing (meds, hospitalization, counseling, therapy)
In Crisis - state of emergency, need immediate health; suicidal, severe anxiety/depression, social isolation, lack of self-care. High risk for SI. Needs inpatient treatment, intensive mental health care.
Self-Check Tool:
Healthy happy and satisfied with life; emotionally balanced, healthy coping, normal mood fluctuations
consistent performance, healthy sleep, self-confidence evident, comfortable in relationships Reacting - (Common and Reversible Stress) acute stress from life events, requires self-care and social support
coping difficulty but daily living intact =&gt; FORGETFULLNESS
irritability, impatience, nervousness, sadness, worry, procrastination forgetfulness, intrusive thoughts
sleep problems, social withdrawal Injured (Significant Functional Impairment) requires professional care =&gt; prolonged distress, poor coping, impaired ADL
Anger, anxiety, prolonged sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, decreased performance Ill (Clinical Disorder, Severe Impairment) emergency! needs professional treatment
inability to cope with stress, extreme thot and behavior changes
severe anxiety, panic attacks, deep depression, fatigue, disturbed reality
suicidal ideation Types of Mental Health Care Settings:
Inpatient → severe dysfunction, safety risk, intense care, 24/7 supervision
Outpatient/Community-Based → nonacute needs, med management, therapy, support
Community-Based Care &amp; Treatment =&gt; for nonacute needs
Primary Care Provider → first contact, monitors overall health, prescribes/monitors meds, refers to therapy
Outpatient Mental Health Clinic → psychiatrist, psychologist, APRNs, therapists, med management, ongoing care
Case Management → nurse/social worker, coordinates meds, appointments, transport, collaborates with team
Home-Based Services → nurse/social worker visits, med support, monitoring; includes ACT (Assertive Community Treatment) model (inpatient-level care at home, improves quality of life)
Telehealth / Telepsychiatry → virtual visits, med management, effective as in-person
Mobile Crisis Teams → emergency care onsite at client’s location
Day Treatment → outpatient center, mental health + job training, nonresidential
Family Services → caregiver tools and support
Peer Services → support from trained peers with lived experience
Inpatient Mental Health Services
Crisis Stabilization Unit → short-term, emergent monitoring, few hours–days (Prof says 24 units max)
Community-Based Hospital Facility → psych unit in hospital, short-term, days–weeks
State Hospital Facility → serious illness, court-ordered, months–years, often criminal justice involvement
Transitional/Respite Unit → post-hospital, prevents readmission, short-term 2–4 weeks
Long-Term Care Facility → chronic illness, ADL support, often indefinite stay
Substance Use Disorder Treatment Centers → detox, acute residential, MAT (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone), psychosocial + peer support
Specialty Care &amp; Treatment
Military Veteran Care → VA programs, crisis care, PTSD, MST
Pediatric/Adolescent Care → child/teen focused, inpatient or specialty facilities, PMHS trained providers
Geriatric Care → older adult needs, long-term programs, government resources
Forensic Care → clients with criminal convictions, rehab + safety balance, diversion programs prevent incarceration, court-ordered care MH is a public health issue
Focus of PH Model: promoting mental health well-being
preventing mental disorders
improving access to community mental health services
providing support throughout the disease process
supporting recovery,
lowering the incidences of death, disease, and disability among those with mental illnesses 2 Categories of mental illness:
AMI - any mental illness
SMI - serious mental illness - severe functional impairment, resulting in possible permanent disability.
National Mental Health Act of 1946 - more resources into research, mental illness; education/research programsCommunity Mental Health Act (CMHA) - called for comprehensive community health centers to offer services to people with mental illness who were deinstitutionalized.Underserved populations at Risk for M.I.:
densely populated lower-income communities =&gt; drugs, violence, crime
rural areas - lack of access
elderly
non white
veterans
homeless
Causes of At-Risk status:
SDOH
ACE - adverse childhood events
Geographical settings - rural areas, poor
marginalization - racism and shit
Incarcerated - high rates of MI1963 Community Mental Health Act unintentionally worsened houselessness by releasing individuals without ensuring housingLevels of Prevention:
Primary prevention aims to prevent mental illness through client and environmental support, education, and stressor reduction.
Secondary prevention minimizes early symptoms through screenings, early intervention, and managing minor issues like anxiety.
Tertiary prevention reduces long-term disability, focusing on treatment, management, and helping clients function in society.
MTSS - Multitiered System of Support
promotion - universal care for everyone
prevention - targeted
individualized - intensive
Barriers to Mental Health Care:
Lack of available treatment options or providers
Inadequate transportation, childcare, or unable to take time off work.
Held belief that mental health treatment “does not work”
High level of mental health stigma in cultural or ethnic group
Racism, bias, and discrimination in treatment settings
Language barriers or lack of providers who speak languages other than English
Lack of adequate health insurance coverage
Sub-Headers:
accessibility - rural areas
lack of culturally competent care
affordability
availability of care and treatment - not enough providers
How to reduce disparities:
Provide culturally sensitive client-centered care
Increase workforce diversity
Improve awareness of disparities related to mental health care and treatment
Promote cultural and language competence
Provide education during nursing school on the Social Determinates of Health and Mental Health
Advocate for system and legislative changes to reduce disparities

based on freud
help a client to express any repressed emotions, bringing unconscious thoughts to the conscious mind
transference - when the client develops feelings toward the therapist or health care worker in a way that mimics a relationship that was significant in their childhood
Countertransference - therapist or health care worker unconsciously has feelings toward the client that reminds them of an individual in their past. It can be positive or negative. type of psychotherapy that focuses on modifying a client’s maladaptive behavior patterns and responses, and instead utilizing adaptative behaviors. Maladaptive Behavior - Behaviors that prevent an individual from coping with new or difficult circumstances, problems, or environments. address current issues (from the past)
remove negative thought process
therapist will often identify the thoughts an individual has that enhance or contribute to one’s anxiety premise: mental health problem is based in part on faulty thinking or unhealthy thoughts, related feelings, and learned patterns of behaviors.
learn better ways of coping (new ways of thinking) that will lead to better patterns of living (behaviors).
helping the individual recognize the thought patterns that created their current situation and reevaluate them in light of the current situation and apply new behaviors
examples of who can benefit: depression, anxiety, eating disorders, tourette's aka psychotherapy
promote the client’s well-being and assist or eliminate a client’s symptoms so they can continue with daily life aka psychosocial therapy
groups are formed based on a specific diagnosis to best assist group members.
members often act as a support network and guide their peers toward ways to improve coping skills and adapt to life changes
varies by age: i.e. play therapy for kids can be traditional or nontraditional
can be related to divorce, the death of a family member, communication problems, substance use, interpersonal conflicts, or behavioral problems, potentially among children form of psychotherapy in which the environment is controlled to assist the client in preventing self-destructive or maladaptive behaviors. pharmacology
brain-stimulating activities: vagus nerve stim, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, deep brain sim, ECT, etc virtual video conference, telephone, or even online chat
for those who do not have the ability to leave home, live in areas where therapy is not close, or even those who cannot meet the schedule of most therapists. yoga, exercise, etc
dietics

id, superego, ego Id - instant gratification
Superego - concerned with morals and following rules; "ideal self", "conscience"
Ego - rational, realistic part of the personality that mediates between the id's impulses and the superego's moral demands human behavior is influenced by childhood experiences
behavior is based on childhood experiences; part of an individual’s conscious awareness and unconscious memories
experiences shape an individual’s personality. interpersonal relationships and social experiences assist in shaping an individual’s self.
Three Types of Self: =&gt; based on social assessment The Good Me
The Bad Me
The NOT me - unknown, or the part of an individual that is often repressed anxiety is there when there is negative feedback
Peplau’s Interpersonal Relations Model
defines the nurse-client relationship as occurring in four distinct, overlapping phases Stages: Pre-interaction - nurse reviews data, anticipates concerns
Orientation - nurse explains their role; pt expresses needs, sense of belonging, etc
Working - work together to achieve goals
Termination - nurse and client achieved goals, end of relationship Behaviorism - focused on observed behaviors (as opposed to unconscious mental state)
John Watson
Classical Conditioning (Pavlov) - associative learning, focuses on unconscious memory
Operant Conditioning (B.F. Skinner) - behavior followed by positive consequences is likely to be repeated, and behavior followed by negative consequences is less likely to be repeated. human behaviors are influenced by an individual’s thought process
Social cognitive theory is a form of cognitive therapy in which an individual models behaviors observed by others (e.g. peer pressure) Humanism - individual is studied or viewed as a whole
Maslow, Rogers, Bugental
"people are innately good"
Mental or social illness causes deviations from this core concept
Rogers - individuals perceive the world based on their own experiences, which are then reflected in their personality and behaviors to meet self-actualization. Bugental - humans are a single entity and cannot be broken down into parts begin with child development and progress throughout the lifespan with distinct stages describing behavioral differences
Piaget - human intelligence is based on one’s biological ability to adapt to one’s environment; intelligence advances with age
Erikson - each stage has specific tasks or goals to be plotted out and achieved so that resolution can occur
see <a data-href="Developmental Theories" href="peds/growth-development/by-domains/developmental-theories.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Developmental Theories</a> based on Lawrence Kohlberg’s stages not tied to a specific age group, but rather to levels that can often be noted at specific ages *Preconventional Level (self-interest, obedience, avoid punishment)* Stage 1: Obedience and Punishment – morality based on avoiding punishment, rules seen as fixed
Stage 2: Instrumental Relativist Orientation – right action based on self-interest, fair exchange or “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” *Conventional Level (conformity, social order)* Stage 3: Interpersonal Relationships – morality defined by approval, “good boy/good girl” orientation, pleasing others
Stage 4: Law and Order – respect for authority, duty, following laws to maintain society *Postconventional Level (abstract reasoning, universal principles)* Stage 5: Social Contract and Individual Rights – laws as social contracts, can be changed for the greater good, recognition of differing values
Stage 6: Universal Ethical Principles – "golden rule"; morality based on internal principles of justice and equality, may conflict with laws provides an explanation of mental health disorders as a malfunction within the body
offers insight into how the brain’s anatomy, genomics, psychopharmacology, and neurotransmitters influence mental health ]]></description><link>psych/i.-foundations/iv.-theories.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Psych/i.

A malignant tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, originating from neural crest cells.1 It is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. Neuroblastoma = Nervous Baby Tumor Exact cause is unknown. It is thought to be a genetic mutation in the developing neural crest cells, which normally form the sympathetic nervous system. Most cases are sporadic, but a small percentage can be familial. Arises from immature neuroblasts in the adrenal glands (most common site), chest, neck, or spinal cord. The tumor secretes catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine), leading to various symptoms. Can metastasize early and widely to bone, bone marrow, liver, skin, and lymph nodes. Clinical Pearl: High levels of catecholamine metabolites (HVA and VMA) in urine are a key diagnostic marker Age: Occurs most often in infants and young children, with over half of cases diagnosed before the age of 2. Genetics: A small number of cases are hereditary. Abdominal Mass: A firm, irregular mass in the abdomen that can cross the midline. Unlike Wilms' tumor, it's often irregular. Metastasis: Bone pain or limp (bone metastasis) Periorbital ecchymosis ("raccoon eyes") and proptosis (orbital metastasis). Hepatomegaly (liver metastasis). Skin nodules (dermal metastasis). Catecholamine-related symptoms: Hypertension, flushing, and sweating
Diarrhea (due to vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion) Other: Anorexia, weight loss, irritability, and fever. Metastatic disease. Spinal cord compression leading to paralysis. Bone marrow suppression from tumor infiltration or chemotherapy. Tumor-related syndromes like opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome ("dancing eyes and feet") Urine Catecholamine Metabolites: Elevated levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA).9 This is a hallmark test. Biopsy: Confirms the diagnosis and staging.10 Imaging: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI to locate the primary tumor and assess for spread.
Bone Marrow Aspiration/Biopsy: To check for bone marrow involvement. MIBG Scan: A nuclear medicine scan that uses a radioactive tracer taken up by neuroblastoma cells to detect primary and metastatic disease. Surgery: To remove the primary tumor.
Chemotherapy: The main treatment for advanced disease. Radiation Therapy: Used for high-risk tumors or to treat specific sites of metastasis (e.g., bone pain, spinal cord compression) Stem Cell Transplant: For high-risk disease. Immunotherapy: A newer approach using antibodies to target neuroblastoma cells. NCLEX Tip: The hallmark of neuroblastoma is elevated urine HVA and VMA levels. Monitor for signs and symptoms of catecholamine excess (e.g., hypertension, tachycardia). Provide meticulous skin care due to risk of skin breakdown and pain from bone lesions. Monitor for and manage side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, vomiting, and myelosuppression (risk of infection, bleeding, and anemia). Neuroblastoma is NOT palpated, but unlike Wilms' tumor, a sign isn't posted to avoid it, as the tumor is often already metastatic and palpation won't change the prognosis. However, gentle handling is always a good practice. Provide comprehensive pain management, especially for bone pain. Explain the disease process and the importance of adhering to the complex treatment plan. Educate parents on monitoring for signs of infection (fever, chills) due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy. Advise on nutrition and hydration, as children may have a poor appetite. Teach parents how to manage pain and administer medications at home. Emphasize the importance of follow-up appointments and long-term monitoring.

The most severe form of spina bifida, a type of neural tube defect (NTD). It involves a sac-like protrusion on the back containing meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and a portion of the spinal cord and nerves. Results in permanent neurological damage below the level of the lesion. Failure of the embryonic neural tube to close completely during the first month of pregnancy (around day 28). The exact cause is a multifactorial combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Incomplete closure of the posterior vertebral arch allows the spinal cord and meninges to herniate through the opening. The exposed neural tissue is underdeveloped and damaged, leading to a loss of motor and sensory function distal to the defect. Often associated with Chiari II malformation, where the brainstem and cerebellum are pulled downward, obstructing CSF flow and causing hydrocephalus. Folic acid deficiency before and during pregnancy is the most significant risk factor. Family history of neural tube defects. Maternal use of certain medications (e.g., valproic acid, carbamazepine). Maternal diabetes or obesity. Maternal fever or hyperthermia in early pregnancy. Visible sac-like lesion on the spine, most commonly in the lumbosacral region. The sac may be thin and prone to rupture. Paralysis or weakness of the lower extremities (flaccid paralysis). Lack of sensation below the level of the lesion. Neurogenic bladder and bowel: Incontinence, retention, and constipation due to lack of nerve control. Orthopedic issues: Clubfoot, hip dysplasia, and scoliosis are common. Hydrocephalus: Present in about 80-90% of infants, evidenced by a rapidly increasing head circumference and bulging fontanelles. Common: neurogenic bladder =&gt;always assess for bladder distention and incomplete emptying
Hydrocephalus: Requires placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Infection: High risk of meningitis if the sac ruptures. Tethered Cord Syndrome: Scar tissue forms and attaches the spinal cord to surrounding structures, causing progressive neurological deterioration. Chronic kidney disease from recurrent UTIs and urinary retention. Latex Allergy: Extremely common due to frequent exposure during surgeries and catheterizations. Assume every child with spina bifida has a latex allergy. 🤧 Prenatal: Elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screen, confirmed by fetal ultrasound and amniocentesis (which shows high levels of alpha-fetoprotein). Postnatal: Obvious physical defect at birth. An MRI or CT scan is used to assess the extent of spinal cord involvement and to check for hydrocephalus. Immediate Pre-operative Care: Protect the sac! The infant is placed in a radiant warmer to remain unclothed. Position the infant prone (on their stomach) to prevent pressure on the sac. Cover the sac with a sterile, moist, non-adherent dressing to prevent drying and rupture. Keep the area free of contamination from urine and feces (use a protective drape). Surgery: Surgical closure of the back lesion is typically performed within 24-72 hours of birth to reduce the risk of infection. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) Shunt: A shunt is surgically placed to treat hydrocephalus by draining excess CSF from the brain's ventricles to the abdominal cavity. Lifelong Management: Requires a multidisciplinary team (neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics, PT/OT). Includes clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for bladder management and a bowel program. NCLEX Tip: The absolute priority for a newborn with a myelomeningocele is to protect the sac from injury and infection. Pre-op Mnemonic - SAC: Sterile Dressing: Cover with a sterile, saline-soaked, non-adherent dressing. Change it regularly (q2-4h) to keep it moist. Asepsis: Use strict sterile technique. Monitor for signs of infection (fever, irritability, lethargy). Contamination Prevention: Position infant prone with hips slightly flexed to keep urine and stool away from the lesion. Post-op Care: Monitor vital signs, intake/output, pain, and the surgical incision for signs of infection or CSF leakage. Continue prone positioning until cleared by the surgeon. Hydrocephalus Monitoring: Measure head circumference daily. Assess fontanelles for bulging and monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) like a high-pitched cry, vomiting, and sunsetting eyes. Latex Precautions: Ensure a latex-free environment for all care. Use non-latex gloves, catheters, and supplies. Teach parents how to perform clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and manage a bowel regimen. Educate on the signs and symptoms of a VP shunt malfunction: headache, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, swelling along the shunt track, and changes in behavior or school performance. Explain the importance of a latex-free environment and provide a list of common latex-containing products (e.g., balloons, rubber toys). Instruct on proper skin care and positioning to prevent pressure injuries, especially on areas with no sensation. Encourage range-of-motion exercises to prevent contractures. Connect the family with the Spina Bifida Association and other community support resources. ❤️

Obstruction or narrowing (e.g., pulmonary stenosis) increases right-sided pressure
Hypoxemia and cyanosis due to poor oxygenation
Body compensates via polycythemia, clubbing

Pulmonary Stenosis Mixed disorders Patho: Mixing of well-oxygenated pulmonary venous blood with poorly oxygenated systemic venous blood
Mixed blood enters systemic circulation → lower arterial oxygen saturation
Often leads to cyanosis, decreased cardiac output, and heart failure
Typically ductal-dependent, requiring PGE1 and surgical intervention
Not responsive to O2 treatment
Often no murmur
Tires out easily =&gt; need to conserve energy; poor weight gain Examples: Transposition of the Great Vessels (TGV) aorta and pulmonary artery are switched =&gt; NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LIFE, immediate surgery
Aorta arises from RV and pulmonary artery from LV → parallel circulations
Oxygenated and deoxygenated blood only mix via ASD, VSD, or PDA Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) - Pulmonary veins drain into right atrium instead of left atrium
Truncus Arteriosus - both ventricles eject blood into the same artery → complete mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) Underdeveloped LV, aortic valve, and ascending aorta

A group of diseases that affect the heart muscle, impairing its ability to pump blood effectively.
Can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
no cure. Once heart muscle is altered, that is permanent. Classification:
Dilated (DCM) - most common enlargement of the ventricles with reduced systolic function and decreased EF
Causes: Idiopathic, ischemic heart disease, alcohol abuse, viral infections, toxins, genetic mutations
symptoms: chest discomfort, peripheral edema, exponentially increasing levels of fatigue as the condition progresses, and exertional dyspnea. Hypertrophic (HCM) thickened ventricular walls, most commonly affecting the interventricular septum, leading to diastolic dysfunction.
causes: Genetic mutations
symptoms: fatigue, syncopal episodes, chest discomfort or palpitations, exhaustion, and dyspnea Restrictive (RCM) Stiffened ventricular walls due to fibrosis or infiltration, leading to impaired diastolic filling while systolic function is preserved
poor prognosis; least common
causes: Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, radiation therapy, idiopathic.
symptoms: similar to HF with DCM/HCM Arrhythmogenic (ACM) Fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, leading to arrhythmias and structural changes
Causes: Genetic mutations (autosomal dominant), familial
symptoms: ascites, increased JVD, and lethal dysrhythmias, VFib, VTach, including manifestations of other CMs Fluid overload: <a data-href="Diuretics" href="pharmacology/cardiovascular/diuretics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diuretics</a> and vasodilators

DCM or RCM: heart transplant, LVAD (left ventricular assist device): can be permanent or temporary fix until transplant
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): Prevents sudden cardiac death.
Pacemaker: Helps regulate heart rhythm.

Congenital narrowing of the aortic lumen, usually near the ductus arteriosus
Causes obstructed blood flow to lower body
Classified as pre-ductal (infantile) or post-ductal (adult-type) Narrowed aorta → ↑ afterload on LV → LV hypertrophy
Blood flow to upper body = ↑ pressure
Blood flow to lower body = ↓ pressure
In infants: ductus arteriosus closure removes alternate route → acute ↓ perfusion
In adults: collaterals may form (intercostal arteries), masking symptoms
Can cause CHF, acidosis, and shock in infants if severe Echocardiogram = confirms anatomy
4-limb blood pressures: upper extremity HTN + lower extremity hypotension
Pulse check: bounding upper pulses, weak/absent femoral pulses
CXR: rib notching (adults), cardiomegaly (infants)
ECG: LVH
MRI/CT angio for surgical planning high BP proximal, low BP distal high BP in arms
low BP in lower extremities Infants (severe cases): Poor feeding, lethargy
Pale, cool lower extremities
Shock-like state when ductus closes Older children/adults: HTN (arms), HA, epistaxis
Leg cramps, cold feet
Systolic murmur (left infraclavicular/back) Congenital, often isolated
May occur with other heart defects: Bicuspid aortic valve, VSD
Associated with Turner syndrome Genetic syndromes (Turner, Williams)
Family history of CHD Infants: Prostaglandin E1 to keep ductus open
Surgical repair (resection with anastomosis or patch) -&gt; within 1st year of life Older children/adults: Balloon angioplasty +/- stent
Lifelong cardiology follow-up
Treat residual HTN Monitor BP in all four limbs
Check femoral pulses regularly
Administer PGE1 if indicated
Pre/post-op care: monitor for HTN, bleeding, neuro checks
Educate on long-term BP monitoring
Screen siblings if familial HTN, even after repair
Aortic aneurysm, dissection
Re-coarctation (especially in neonates)
Stroke, endocarditis
LV failure if untreated

Inflammation of the endocardium, typically affecting the heart valves, caused by infection (infective endocarditis) or, rarely, non-infectious processes.
endo = inner, itis = inflammation. endocarditis = inflammation of the inner heart
Infectious: Bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Enterococcus), fungi (Candida, Aspergillus), less commonly viruses.
most common type
mold or bacterial vegetation on the valves
more common on L side (aortic and mitral/bi valve)
Non-Infectious: Autoimmune conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus – Libman-Sacks endocarditis), malignancies.
Prosthetic heart valves
Congenital heart defects
Rheumatic heart disease
History of endocarditis
IV drug use
Poor dental hygiene or invasive dental procedures =&gt; strep throat (how creator of muppets died)
Indwelling catheters or central lines
Immunosuppression (e.g., HIV, chemotherapy).
CLOT mnemonic
Clots in heart and body
Lung fluids - crackles &amp; spleen enlarged d/t heart failure &amp; infection
Ovearheated - fever
Too little oxygen = signs of heart failure
General Symptoms: Fever, fatigue, night sweats, malaise, weight loss.
Cardiac Symptoms: New or changing heart murmur, signs of heart failure (demand&gt;output)
Peripheral Signs: Petechiae (small red spots on skin or mucosa)
Splinter hemorrhages (linear streaks under nails)
Janeway lesions (painless, flat red spots on palms/soles)
Osler nodes (painful nodules on fingers/toes)
Roth spots (retinal hemorrhages with pale centers). Complications: Embolic events (e.g., stroke, pulmonary embolism), abscess formation, septicemia. IV antibiotics for 4-6 weeks (based on blood culture results).
Antifungals if fungal endocarditis is confirmed.
Surgical Intervention: Valve repair or replacement if extensive damage, persistent infection, or complications (e.g., heart failure, abscess). Monitor for signs of embolic events (neurological changes, limb ischemia).
Assess for heart failure (dyspnea, edema, fatigue).
Administer antibiotics on schedule and monitor for side effects.
Educate on completing full antibiotic course.
Encourage proper dental hygiene to prevent recurrence.
Monitor for fever and new murmurs, indicating treatment failure. Blood Cultures: Positive in most cases, with at least two sets needed before antibiotics.
Echocardiography: Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to detect vegetations, valve damage, or abscess.
Labs: Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), leukocytosis, anemia.
ECG: May show conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias.
Other Tests: Imaging to detect embolic complications (e.g., CT for stroke, pulmonary embolism).

<a data-href="Congenital Heart Diseases" href="peds/cardiac/congenital/congenital-heart-diseases.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Congenital Heart Diseases</a>, four main abnormalities: Pulmonary stenosis - Right ventricular hypertrophy
Overriding aorta
Ventricular septal defect =&gt; (PROV) - PROV It! Cyanotic heart disease (right-to-left shunting) Unknown in most cases
Genetic and environmental factors implicated Pulmonary Stenosis: Narrowing of the pulmonary valve or artery, obstructing blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs. Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD): Hole between the right and left ventricles, allowing blood to shunt. Overriding Aorta: Aorta is displaced to the right, sitting directly over the VSD, receiving blood from both ventricles. Right Ventricular Hypertrophy: Right ventricle muscle thickens from increased workload due to pulmonary stenosis and pumping against systemic pressure via the VSD. Shunting: Degree of pulmonary stenosis dictates direction of shunt and severity of symptoms. Mild Stenosis: May be left-to-right shunt (acyanotic) initially. Severe Stenosis: Increased right ventricular pressure forces deoxygenated blood through the VSD into the left ventricle and overriding aorta (right-to-left shunt) = cyanosis. Tet Spells: Acute increase in right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (spasm), leading to a sudden, dramatic increase in right-to-left shunting and severe cyanosis. Maternal rubella or other viral illnesses during pregnancy
Poor maternal nutrition
Maternal alcohol consumption
Maternal age over 40
Diabetes in the mother
Genetic disorders (e.g., Down syndrome) Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of skin, lips, nail beds), especially with crying or feeding
"Tet spells" (hypercyanotic spells): sudden, marked increase in cyanosis, dyspnea, limpness - Think "Tet-a-tat-tat" = rapid onset
Clubbing of fingers and toes (chronic hypoxemia)
Difficulty feeding, poor weight gain
Fatigue, irritability
Heart murmur (loud, harsh systolic ejection murmur) Polycythemia (increased red blood cells due to chronic hypoxemia)
Thromboembolism (stroke risk from polycythemia)
Brain abscess (risk from paradoxical emboli)
Endocarditis
Arrhythmias
Ventricular dysfunction Echocardiogram: Confirms diagnosis, visualizes all four defects
Chest X-ray: "Boot-shaped" heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy
ECG: Right ventricular hypertrophy, right axis deviation
Cardiac catheterization (less common for diagnosis, more for intervention planning)
Pulse oximetry: Low oxygen saturation Medical Management (temporary/palliative): Tet spells: Place infant in knee-chest position (increases SVR, decreases right-to-left shunt) - Knee-chest = Kicking Cyanosis
Administer oxygen
Morphine sulfate (calms infant, decreases infundibular spasm)
IV fluids
Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) to prevent spasms Prostaglandin E1: To maintain patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in severe cases (to increase pulmonary blood flow) Surgical Repair (definitive): Usually performed between 4-6 months of age
Includes widening of the pulmonary outflow tract, patching the VSD, and addressing overriding aorta. Monitoring: Closely monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and signs of cyanosis.
Assess for growth and development.
Monitor for signs of heart failure (rare pre-op, can occur post-op). Tet Spell Management (NCLEX Tip): Prioritize knee-chest position first, then oxygen, then medications. Document spell characteristics and interventions. quiet environment
pacifier
small &amp; frequent feedings
swaddle or hold infant Fluid Balance: Maintain adequate hydration to prevent polycythemia and reduce stroke risk.
Infection Prevention: Prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures/surgeries (to prevent endocarditis).
Post-operative care: Strict I&amp;O, pain management, wound care, cardiac monitoring, gradual increase in activity.
Emotional Support: Provide support to parents/caregivers, addressing anxieties and fears. Disease understanding: Explain TOF in simple terms, including the four defects and potential symptoms.
Tet spell recognition and management: Teach parents how to identify a tet spell and the appropriate actions (knee-chest position, remaining calm, seeking medical attention).
Medication administration: Proper dosage, timing, and side effects.
Infection prevention: Importance of good oral hygiene and prophylactic antibiotics.
Nutritional needs: Encourage frequent, small feeds; high-calorie formula if needed.
Activity restrictions: Guide parents on appropriate activity levels for the child, balancing rest and play.
Follow-up care: Emphasize the importance of regular cardiology appointments.
Surgical preparation and post-op care: Prepare parents for the surgical process and what to expect during recovery.

Phase 1: Tension Building – Victim walks on eggshells, internalizes blame to prevent violence. Phase 2: Physically Abusive Phase – Violence erupts; victim minimizes harm and avoids care. Phase 3: Honeymoon – Abuser apologizes; victim clings to hope and feels responsible.
Phases of Rape Victims
Acute phase (disorganization) – Overwhelmed by shock, fear, and intense emotional distress. Outward adjustment phase (denial) – Appears stable but suppresses trauma and avoids help. Reorganization – Struggles resurface, survivor seeks change and emotional distance. Integration and recovery – Regains trust, feels empowered, may support others.

Key Purpose: Designed to bypass the non-functional fetal lungs and liver, prioritizing oxygenated blood to the brain and heart.
Oxygenation Source: Placenta (maternal blood).
Major Shunts: Ductus Venosus: Bypasses the liver, shunting oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein directly to the inferior vena cava.
Foramen Ovale: An opening between the right and left atria, shunting oxygenated blood from the right atrium to the left atrium, bypassing the lungs.
Ductus Arteriosus: Connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta, shunting blood from the pulmonary artery away from the lungs into the systemic circulation. Vessels: Umbilical Vein (1): Carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus.
Umbilical Arteries (2): Carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus back to the placenta. Blood Flow Path: Oxygenated blood from placenta Umbilical vein Ductus venosus Inferior vena cava Right atrium Foramen ovale Left atrium Left ventricle Aorta (to head/upper body) / Some from right atrium Right ventricle Pulmonary artery Ductus arteriosus Aorta (to lower body) / Small amount to lungs Hypogastric (internal iliac) arteries Umbilical arteries Placenta. Underlying Issues: Conditions that compromise uteroplacental function or fetal cardiovascular development.
Examples of Risk Factors/Conditions: Placental Insufficiency: Reduced blood flow or damage to the placenta (e.g., preeclampsia, chronic abruption, maternal hypertension/diabetes) leading to inadequate oxygen/nutrient exchange.
Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR): Often a consequence of compromised placental function, leading to adaptive fetal circulatory changes (e.g., brain-sparing effect where blood is preferentially shunted to the brain).
Congenital Heart Defects (CHDs): Structural abnormalities of the heart or great vessels that alter normal fetal shunting patterns and blood flow, potentially leading to cardiac strain or inadequate oxygenation (e.g., hypoplastic left heart syndrome, transposition of the great arteries).
Fetal Anemia: Reduces oxygen-carrying capacity, forcing the fetal heart to work harder.
Fetal Infection: Some infections (e.g., TORCH) can directly damage the fetal heart or vasculature, impacting circulation.
Persistent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) / Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) after birth: Failure of these fetal shunts to close post-natally leads to abnormal shunting, increased pulmonary blood flow (PDA), or deoxygenated blood entering systemic circulation (PFO with right-to-left shunt).
Pulmonary Hypertension (PPHN): Failure of pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease at birth, leading to persistent shunting away from the lungs (via PFO and PDA), resulting in hypoxemia. Manifestations of Compromise: Abnormal Doppler flow studies (e.g., absent/reversed end-diastolic flow in umbilical artery).
Fetal bradycardia or tachycardia (indicating distress).
Hydrops fetalis (fluid accumulation in fetal compartments).
Altered fetal growth.
Abnormal shunting patterns observed on fetal echocardiogram. Clinical Significance: These high-risk variations require close monitoring and often intervention to optimize fetal well-being or prepare for postnatal management.

Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG): Maintains the corpus luteum to ensure continued progesterone production in early pregnancy.
Progesterone: Maintains the uterine lining, relaxes uterine muscles, and prevents preterm contractions.
Estrogen (primarily Estriol): Stimulates uterine growth, promotes uteroplacental blood flow, and prepares the breasts for lactation.
Human Placental Lactogen (hPL) / Human Chorionic Somatomammotropin (hCS): Modifies maternal metabolism to provide nutrients for the fetus and prepares mammary glands for lactation.
Relaxin: Relaxes pelvic ligaments and softens the cervix, aiding in childbirth.
Placental Growth Hormone: Regulates maternal metabolism and fetal growth, becoming predominant later in pregnancy.
Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH): Influences the timing of labor and fetal lung maturation.

Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) in newborns, most commonly refers to Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN).
PPHN is a condition where the normal drop in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at birth fails to occur, or it increases after initially falling.
This results in high blood pressure in the arteries supplying the lungs, leading to reduced blood flow to the lungs for oxygenation.
Deoxygenated blood then bypasses the lungs via fetal shunts (foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus), leading to severe hypoxemia.
It is a failure of the normal circulatory transition from fetal to extrauterine life. Failure of Normal Circulatory Transition: Pulmonary vessels remain constricted or become constricted after birth.
Underlying Lung Diseases: <a data-href="Meconium Aspiration Syndrome" href="ob/v.-newborn/complications/meconium-aspiration-syndrome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Meconium Aspiration Syndrome</a> (MAS) - most common cause.

Pneumonia or Sepsis.
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) - leads to underdeveloped lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia).
Pulmonary Hypoplasia (e.g., due to oligohydramnios). Maldevelopment of Pulmonary Vasculature: Abnormal structure or number of pulmonary vessels.
Idiopathic PPHN: No clear underlying cause.
In Utero Closure of Ductus Arteriosus. Perinatal Asphyxia: Lack of oxygen before, during, or after birth.
Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS).
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS).
Sepsis/Pneumonia.
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH).
Maternal factors: Diabetes, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, maternal obesity, smoking, use of SSRIs or NSAIDs during late pregnancy.
Delivery: Cesarean section (without labor), precipitous delivery.
Fetal factors: Large for gestational age (LGA), small for gestational age (SGA), post-term gestation.
Congenital Heart Defects: Such as transposition of the great arteries. Signs usually appear within the first 12-72 hours of life.
Severe Hypoxemia: Low oxygen levels despite receiving 100% oxygen.
Labile Oxygenation: Oxygen saturation fluctuates wildly.
Respiratory Distress: Tachypnea (rapid breathing), retractions (subcostal, intercostal), nasal flaring, grunting.
Cyanosis: Bluish discoloration of skin and mucous membranes, may be differential (pink upper body, cyanotic lower body) if ductus arteriosus is open with right-to-left shunt.
Tachycardia.
Hypotension.
Heart Murmur: Due to shunting through patent ductus arteriosus or patent foramen ovale.
Cool extremities.
Poor perfusion.
NCLEX Tip: Persistent hypoxemia despite maximal oxygen support is a hallmark of PPHN. Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE): Brain damage due to lack of oxygen.
Multi-organ dysfunction: Kidney injury, liver dysfunction.
Pulmonary Hemorrhage.
Barotrauma/Volutrauma: Due to mechanical ventilation (e.g., pneumothorax).
Hearing loss.
Neurodevelopmental Impairment: Learning disabilities, developmental delays, cerebral palsy.
Chronic Lung Disease (Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia).
Death. Clinical Suspicion: Based on symptoms of respiratory distress and persistent hypoxemia.
Hyperoxia Test: Administering 100% oxygen. If PaO2 remains low, suggests shunting (PPHN or cyanotic heart disease).
Pre- and Post-Ductal Pulse Oximetry: Significant difference () suggests right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus.
Echocardiogram (Cardiac Ultrasound): Definitive diagnosis. Visualizes heart structure, assesses pulmonary artery pressure, identifies shunting (ductus arteriosus, foramen ovale), and assesses right ventricular function.
Chest X-ray: May show underlying lung disease (e.g., MAS, pneumonia) but often appears normal in primary PPHN.
Arterial Blood Gas (ABG): Shows hypoxemia, often with respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Goal: Reduce PVR, improve oxygenation, support systemic blood pressure.
Supportive Care: Optimal Thermoregulation: Maintain neutral thermal environment.
Minimize Stimulation/Handling: Cluster care, sedation to reduce agitation and oxygen consumption.
Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Strict monitoring.
Nutrition: IV fluids or gavage feedings. Oxygen Therapy: Maintain adequate oxygenation.
Mechanical Ventilation: Often required, carefully managed to avoid lung injury, optimize lung volume, and minimize PVR.
Pharmacological Agents: Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO): First-line specific pulmonary vasodilator. Selectively relaxes pulmonary blood vessels without affecting systemic blood pressure.
Sildenafil (Viagra/Revatio): Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, used orally or IV to relax pulmonary vessels.
Milrinone: Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, improves cardiac contractility and causes pulmonary vasodilation.
Prostaglandins (e.g., Iloprost): Pulmonary vasodilators.
Vasopressors/Inotropes: (e.g., Dopamine, Dobutamine) to maintain systemic blood pressure and cardiac output, ensuring adequate perfusion and preventing shunting. Surfactant Therapy: If underlying RDS or MAS with surfactant deficiency.
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO): Cardiopulmonary bypass used for severe, refractory PPHN when maximal conventional therapy fails. Continuous Monitoring: Intensive care setting. Continuous monitoring of HR, BP, RR, SpO2 (pre- and post-ductal). Arterial line for continuous BP and ABG sampling.
Respiratory Management: Meticulous ventilator management. Avoid sudden changes in settings. Frequent assessment for air leaks (pneumothorax).
Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Strict I&amp;O, monitor electrolytes, acid-base status.
Medication Administration: Administer iNO (requires special equipment/monitoring), vasodilators, inotropes, and sedatives precisely. Monitor for desired effects and adverse reactions (e.g., hypotension with vasodilators).
Minimize Stimulation: Create a quiet, dark environment. Cluster care, handle gently, avoid unnecessary procedures. Sedation often used.
Thermoregulation: Maintain normothermia to minimize oxygen consumption.
Neuroprotection: Monitor for signs of HIE.
Parental Support: This is a critical illness. Provide consistent updates, answer questions honestly, facilitate bonding, and offer emotional support and resources.
NCLEX Tip: Prioritize oxygenation and ventilation, followed by maintaining systemic blood pressure and reducing pulmonary vascular resistance. Recognize signs of deterioration quickly. Explanation of PPHN: Explain the condition simply – that the blood vessels in the lungs are too tight, making it hard for the baby to get enough oxygen.
Causes and Risk Factors: Discuss why their baby might have developed PPHN (e.g., MAS, premature birth, C-section).
Treatment Plan: Detail the various treatments (oxygen, ventilation, iNO, other medications), explaining their purpose and what to expect (e.g., baby will be on a breathing machine, may need special IVs).
Critical Care: Explain the need for intensive monitoring and the equipment in the NICU.
Prognosis and Complications: Be honest about the severity of the condition, potential for long-term complications (brain injury, hearing loss, developmental delays), but also offer hope and emphasize the importance of early intervention and follow-up.
Parental Role: Explain how parents can help (e.g., minimizing stimulation, talking gently, touch).
Long-term Follow-up: Stress the importance of developmental follow-up clinics, early intervention services, and hearing screenings for neurodevelopmental monitoring.
NCLEX Tip: Reassure parents that PPHN is not their fault and provide them with clear, consistent information to reduce anxiety.

Hemorrhage (bleeding) that occurs in the brain of premature newborns.
Specifically, it involves bleeding into the periventricular (area around the ventricles) and intraventricular (within the ventricles, spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid) regions.
The bleeding originates from the germinal matrix, a highly vascularized and fragile area of the brain found in premature infants, which largely involutes (disappears) by 33-34 weeks gestation.
Graded I to IV based on severity (Papile grading): Grade I: Hemorrhage confined to the germinal matrix (subependymal).
Grade II: Intraventricular hemorrhage without ventricular dilation.
Grade III: Intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilation (blood fills and expands the ventricles).
Grade IV: Hemorrhage extends into the brain parenchyma (tissue) adjacent to the ventricle (often termed periventricular hemorrhagic infarction). Fragile Germinal Matrix Vessels: Premature infants have delicate, immature blood vessels in the germinal matrix that are prone to rupture.
Fluctuations in Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF): Premature infants have impaired cerebral autoregulation (ability to maintain stable CBF despite changes in systemic blood pressure). Sudden increases or decreases in systemic blood pressure can lead to rupture of fragile vessels.
Hypoxia-Ischemia: Lack of oxygen or blood flow to the brain can damage vessels.
Reperfusion Injury: After an ischemic event, restoration of blood flow can cause vessel damage and bleeding. Prematurity: Gestational age weeks (especially extremely low birth weight infants, ).
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS): Requires mechanical ventilation, which can cause fluctuations in blood pressure and CBF.
Mechanical Ventilation: Especially if unstable (e.g., rapid changes in ventilatory settings).
Perinatal Asphyxia/Hypoxia.
Rapid changes in blood pressure: Hypotension followed by rapid fluid resuscitation or use of vasopressors.
Acidosis.
Pneumothorax.
Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA).
Sepsis/Infection.
Coagulopathy/Bleeding disorders.
Rapid volume expansion.
Umbilical cord clamping delays.
Traumatic delivery.
Maternal factors: Chorioamnionitis, maternal hypertension (some studies).
NCLEX Tip: The more premature the infant, the higher the risk of PIVH. Often asymptomatic, especially Grade I/II, detected by screening ultrasound.
Acute Deterioration (more common in Grade III/IV, "saltatory" course): Apnea and bradycardia (sudden onset).
Pallor.
Cyanosis.
Poor muscle tone (hypotonia).
Weak cry, lethargy.
Bulging or tense fontanelle (indicates increased intracranial pressure).
Seizures (focal or generalized).
Decreased reflexes.
Metabolic acidosis.
Drop in hematocrit. NCLEX Tip: Be alert for sudden, unexplained changes in a preterm infant's neurological status, breathing pattern, or vital signs. Hydrocephalus (Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus): Most common complication, especially with Grade III/IV, due to obstruction of CSF flow by blood clots. Requires ventricular taps or shunt placement.
Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL): Damage to the white matter, often due to ischemia or infarction near the hemorrhage, leading to motor deficits.
Cerebral Palsy (CP): Especially spastic diplegia (affecting legs more), related to white matter injury.
Neurodevelopmental Impairment: Cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, behavioral problems.
Seizure disorder.
Vision and hearing impairment.
Death: More common with severe (Grade III/IV) hemorrhage. Cranial Ultrasound (CUS): Primary diagnostic tool. Non-invasive, bedside, highly effective. Recommended for all infants weeks gestation: At 7-14 days of life (when most bleeds manifest).
Repeat at 4-6 weeks corrected age, or if clinical signs suggest deterioration.
Earlier screening within the first 72 hours for high-risk infants. MRI: May be used for more detailed evaluation, especially in later follow-up or if CUS is inconclusive. No specific treatment to stop the bleeding once it occurs.
Supportive Care (primary focus is prevention and minimizing secondary injury): Stabilize blood pressure: Avoid wide fluctuations (both hypotension and hypertension).
Respiratory support: Optimize ventilation, minimize hypercapnia or hypocapnia.
Maintain normal acid-base balance.
Minimize handling/stress: Cluster care, gentle movements.
Head in midline position: Avoid neck hyperextension/flexion.
Strict fluid and electrolyte management.
Correct coagulopathies. Management of Hydrocephalus (if develops): Serial lumbar punctures/ventricular taps: To remove CSF and reduce pressure.
Ventricular reservoir placement: Temporary measure to drain CSF.
Ventricular-peritoneal (VP) shunt: Surgical insertion of a permanent drain from brain to abdomen for CSF drainage. Neuroprotection (Prevention): Antenatal Corticosteroids: Administered to mothers at risk of preterm birth (reduces incidence and severity of PIVH).
Delayed cord clamping: May help stabilize CBF.
Avoidance of rapid intravenous fluid boluses.
Indomethacin (for PDA): May reduce PIVH risk, but controversial. Prevention: Adhere strictly to prevention protocols for preterm infants (e.g., gentle handling, neutral head position, minimal stimulation, careful fluid management).
Neurological Assessment: Frequent and thorough neurological assessments, looking for subtle changes in tone, activity, reflexes, fontanelle, and cry.
Vital Sign Stability: Meticulous monitoring of HR, BP, RR, SpO2. Report significant fluctuations promptly.
Respiratory Support: Ensure optimal ventilatory settings, minimize suctioning trauma.
Fluid Management: Accurately measure intake and output. Administer fluids and medications precisely.
Head Circumference: Measure daily and plot on a growth chart to detect rapid increases indicative of hydrocephalus.
Clustering Care: Organize care activities to minimize disturbances and allow for longer periods of uninterrupted rest.
Pain Management: Assess for and manage pain/discomfort appropriately.
Parental Support: Provide clear, compassionate communication about the infant's condition, prognosis, and potential long-term outcomes. Encourage bonding and involvement in care.
NCLEX Tip: Any sudden change in neurological status, feeding, or vital signs in a preterm infant should raise immediate suspicion for PIVH or its complications. Explanation of PIVH: Explain what the bleed is, why it happened (fragile vessels, prematurity), and its potential implications using clear, simple language.
Grading System: Explain the Papile grading (I-IV) and what each grade signifies in terms of severity and potential outcome.
Prognosis: Be honest but hopeful. For Grade I/II, explain good prognosis. For Grade III/IV, discuss potential for hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and developmental delays, emphasizing that outcomes vary.
Monitoring: Explain the need for frequent ultrasounds and other tests.
Signs of Complications: Educate parents on signs of increasing head circumference, bulging fontanelle, vomiting, irritability, lethargy, or seizures, and when to seek immediate medical attention.
Long-term Follow-up: Stress the importance of developmental follow-up programs (e.g., NICU follow-up clinic, early intervention services) to monitor and support neurodevelopment.
Home Care: If discharged with a shunt, provide detailed instructions on shunt care and signs of malfunction or infection.
Support Resources: Provide information on support groups or resources for parents of preterm infants or children with special needs.

Benign, common, and transient yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera in newborns due to elevated unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin levels.
Occurs in most newborns as part of normal physiological adaptation after birth.
Typically appears after 24 hours of life, peaks at 3-5 days, and resolves within 1-2 weeks.
NOTE: difference in <a data-href="Pathologic Jaundice in Newborns" href="ob/v.-newborn/complications/pathologic-jaundice-in-newborns.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Pathologic Jaundice in Newborns</a> =&gt; appears WITHIN 24 hours
Increased Bilirubin Production: High red blood cell (RBC) volume in newborns.
Shorter lifespan of fetal RBCs (approx. 70-90 days vs. 120 days in adults).
Increased breakdown of RBCs (hemolysis) releasing bilirubin. Impaired Bilirubin Conjugation: Immature neonatal liver has lower levels and activity of UDP-glucuronyl transferase (UGT), the enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin. Increased Enterohepatic Circulation: Higher levels of beta-glucuronidase in the neonatal gut, which deconjugates bilirubin in the intestines.
Slower gut motility and less frequent stools in newborns mean more unconjugated bilirubin is reabsorbed into circulation. Breastfeeding (Breastfeeding Jaundice/Breast Milk Jaundice): Breastfeeding Jaundice (Early-onset): Due to insufficient milk intake, leading to dehydration and increased enterohepatic circulation. Occurs in the first week.
Breast Milk Jaundice (Late-onset): Due to substances in breast milk (e.g., glucuronidase) that interfere with bilirubin conjugation or increase enterohepatic circulation. Can last for several weeks or months. Prematurity (even late preterm, 34-36 weeks).
East Asian ethnicity.
Family history of physiologic jaundice.
Maternal diabetes.
Male gender.
Polycythemia.
History of cephalohematoma or significant bruising. Yellowing of skin and sclera: Typically visible when total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels reach .
Appears after 24 hours of life.
Progression is usually cephalocaudal (starts on face, progresses to trunk and extremities).
Jaundice typically resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks in term infants.
Infant usually appears otherwise healthy, feeding well, and active.
NCLEX Tip: Differentiating between physiologic and pathologic jaundice is crucial. Remember: physiologic jaundice never appears in the first 24 hours of life. Generally no complications as it's a benign process.
Untreated severe hyperbilirubinemia (even if initially physiologic) can become pathologic and lead to: Acute bilirubin encephalopathy.
Kernicterus (chronic bilirubin encephalopathy) - permanent neurological damage. This happens when bilirubin levels are excessively high and toxic to the brain. Clinical assessment: Visual inspection (blanch skin to check for yellowing), typically done every 8-12 hours in the first few days.
Transcutaneous Bilirubin (TcB) measurement: Non-invasive device used for screening. If TcB is high, a TSB (Total Serum Bilirubin) blood test is performed.
Total Serum Bilirubin (TSB) measurement: Blood test is the gold standard. Levels are plotted on a nomogram based on the infant's age in hours to assess risk for hyperbilirubinemia. Assessment of feeding and hydration.
Rule out pathologic causes: If jaundice is severe, early onset, or persists, further investigation is needed (e.g., direct Coombs test, blood type, CBC, direct bilirubin). No specific treatment often required: Many infants with physiologic jaundice do not need intervention beyond monitoring.
Frequent and effective feedings: Breastfed infants: Nurse times in 24 hours to promote bilirubin excretion through stools and ensure adequate hydration. Avoid water or dextrose water supplementation.
Formula-fed infants: Ensure adequate intake. Phototherapy: If TSB levels cross specific thresholds on the nomogram for the infant's age and risk factors. Blue-green light converts unconjugated bilirubin into water-soluble isomers for excretion. Discontinuation of breastfeeding (temporarily): Rarely indicated for breast milk jaundice if bilirubin levels are dangerously high and other measures fail. Mother can pump to maintain supply. Assessment: Visual assessment for jaundice: Check skin color (blanching on forehead/nose), sclera. Note progression.
Feeding assessment: Observe latch, suck, swallow, and number of wet diapers/stools. Promote effective feeding.
Hydration status: Assess fontanelles, skin turgor, mucous membranes.
Vital signs: Especially temperature (phototherapy can cause hyperthermia). Monitoring: Bilirubin levels: Track TcB/TSB results and plot on nomogram.
Weight: Monitor for excessive weight loss.
Output: Document number of wet diapers and stools. Patient Education: Explain physiologic jaundice as a normal process.
Teach parents how to assess for jaundice and when to seek medical attention.
Emphasize the importance of frequent feedings and adequate hydration. Phototherapy Care (if needed): Maximize skin exposure (diaper only).
Apply eye patches.
Monitor temperature closely.
Ensure adequate fluid intake.
Promote parent-infant bonding during breaks. NCLEX Tip: Focus on education and supportive measures. Early and effective feeding is key in preventing severe physiologic jaundice. Normal vs. concerning jaundice: Explain that mild yellowing after 24 hours is common and usually resolves, but explain signs that warrant concern.
Monitoring at home: Teach parents how to check for jaundice (blanching skin) and how far it has progressed.
Feeding is key: Emphasize the importance of frequent (8-12 times/day) and effective feedings to help baby pass bilirubin in stools.
Warning signs to call the provider: Jaundice appears within the first 24 hours of life.
Jaundice spreads rapidly or appears very deep yellow/orange.
Baby is difficult to wake, not feeding well, excessively sleepy, irritable, has a high-pitched cry.
Fewer wet diapers or stools than expected.
Fever. No home remedies: Advise against using using sunlight or other unproven methods for treating jaundice, as they are ineffective and potentially harmful.
Follow-up: Stress the importance of all scheduled bilirubin checks and well-baby visits.

Self-limiting respiratory condition in newborns characterized by rapid breathing shortly after birth.
Caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid.
Also known as "wet lung" or "Type II RDS." Delayed Clearance of Fetal Lung Fluid: During vaginal birth, the thoracic squeeze helps expel fluid from the lungs. In TTN, this mechanism is impaired or incomplete.
Commonly seen in: C-section births (especially elective, without labor).
Rapid vaginal births.
Infants of diabetic mothers.
Late preterm infants (34-36 weeks gestation). Cesarean section delivery (especially without labor onset).
Preterm or late preterm birth (34-36 weeks gestation).
Macrosomia (large-for-gestational-age infant).
Maternal diabetes.
Male gender.
Perinatal asphyxia.
Maternal asthma. Tachypnea: Respiratory rate often breaths/minute (can be breaths/minute).
Retractions: Subcostal, intercostal, or xiphoid retractions.
Nasal flaring.
Grunting: Audible expiratory grunt.
Cyanosis: Mild perioral or circumoral cyanosis, or central cyanosis (if severe).
Increased anteroposterior diameter of the chest.
Symptoms usually appear within the first few hours of birth and resolve within 24-72 hours. Generally benign and self-limiting.
Rarely, severe cases may lead to: Pulmonary hypertension (due to persistent high pulmonary vascular resistance).
Pneumothorax (rare).
Aspiration (if fed orally while tachypneic).
Hypoxia requiring prolonged respiratory support. Clinical presentation: Based on the characteristic signs of respiratory distress appearing shortly after birth and rapid improvement.
Chest X-ray: Classic findings: Prominent perihilar streaking, fluid in the fissures, hyperexpansion, flattened diaphragms, possible cardiomegaly.
Differs from RDS (Hyaline Membrane Disease) which shows diffuse ground-glass appearance and air bronchograms. Blood gas: May show mild hypoxemia.
Rule out other causes: Important to differentiate from more serious conditions like sepsis, pneumonia, or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Supportive Care: Oxygen therapy: Humidified oxygen via nasal cannula or oxygen hood to maintain SpO2 .
Nasal CPAP: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) may be used for persistent hypoxemia or significant retractions.
Thermoregulation: Maintain neutral thermal environment to minimize oxygen consumption.
Nutritional support: IV fluids until respiratory status improves enough for oral feedings to prevent aspiration. Gavage feedings may be used. Monitoring: Continuous pulse oximetry, respiratory rate and effort.
Antibiotics: May be initiated empirically if sepsis cannot be immediately ruled out, especially if risk factors for infection are present. Discontinued if cultures are negative. Respiratory Assessment: Frequent and thorough assessment of respiratory rate, effort, presence of retractions, grunting, nasal flaring, and cyanosis.
Oxygen Administration: Ensure proper setup and monitoring of oxygen delivery.
Thermoregulation: Keep infant warm to prevent cold stress, which increases oxygen demand.
Hydration/Nutrition: Administer IV fluids as prescribed. Withhold oral feedings if respiratory rate is high () to prevent aspiration; initiate gavage feedings.
Positioning: Head of bed slightly elevated, or "sniffing" position to optimize airway.
Parental Support: Explain the condition to parents, reassuring them it is usually temporary and self-limiting. Educate on signs of worsening distress.
Differentiation: Be vigilant for signs that might indicate a more serious underlying condition.
NCLEX Tip: Remember "Too Tired to Nourish": Infants with TTN are often too tachypneic to safely breastfeed or bottle-feed, necessitating gavage feeding or IV fluids. Nature of TTN: Explain that it's a temporary condition due to "wet lungs" that usually resolves quickly.
Symptoms: Describe the symptoms observed (fast breathing, grunting) and why the baby needs monitoring.
Treatment: Explain the purpose of oxygen, IV fluids, and temporary feeding tubes (if used).
Monitoring: Inform parents about the continuous monitoring of breathing and oxygen levels.
Reassurance: Emphasize that most babies recover fully without long-term problems.
Expected Course: Explain that symptoms typically improve within 24-72 hours.
When to Call: Educate parents on signs of respiratory distress to watch for after discharge.

Blood loss of after vaginal birth or after C-section within 24 hours of birth (Primary/Early PPH).
Or, blood loss occurring 24 hours to 6-12 weeks postpartum (Secondary/Late PPH).
A leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide.
5 T's
Tone: uterine atony (most common), distended bladder
Tissue: retained placenta and clots; uterine subinvolution
Trauma: lacerations, hematoma, inversion, rupture
Thrombin: coagulopathy (preexisting or acquired)
Traction: too much pulling on umbilical cord Uterine Atony: Overdistension of uterus (multiples, polyhydramnios, macrosomia).
Prolonged labor, rapid labor.
Grand multiparity ( pregnancies).
Oxytocin use during labor.
MgSO4 administration.
Chorioamnionitis. Trauma: Operative vaginal delivery (forceps, vacuum), precipitous delivery, large infant.
Tissue: Placenta previa, accreta, increta, percreta.
Thrombin: Pre-existing bleeding disorders, severe preeclampsia, placental abruption, sepsis. Early signs: Excessive vaginal bleeding (saturating pads quickly, steady trickle), boggy uterus (not firm).
Late signs (Hypovolemic Shock): Hypotension, tachycardia, pallor, dizziness, oliguria, altered mental status.
NCLEX Tip: Don't wait for signs of shock; recognize and act on early signs of excessive bleeding! Hypovolemic shock.
Anemia.
Acute kidney injury.
Sheehan's Syndrome (postpartum pituitary necrosis due to severe blood loss).
Peripartum hysterectomy.
Maternal death. Clinical assessment: Quantify blood loss (weighing pads/chux, collecting blood in calibrated drapes). Visual estimation often underestimates.
Physical exam: Fundal massage, inspection for lacerations, assessment for retained placental fragments.
Laboratory tests: CBC (H&amp;H), type and crossmatch, coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen). Atony (Fundal Massage &amp; Medications): First-line: Firm uterine fundal massage.
Uterotonics: Oxytocin (Pitocin): IV bolus or infusion. NCLEX Tip: Always first-line uterotonic.
Methylergonovine (Methergine): IM. Contraindicated in hypertension/preeclampsia.
Carboprost tromethamine (Hemabate): IM. Contraindicated in asthma.
Misoprostol (Cytotec): Rectal or oral. Trauma: Repair of lacerations, evacuation of hematomas.
Tissue: Manual removal of retained placenta, D&amp;C (Dilation &amp; Curettage).
Thrombin: Administer blood products (pRBCs, FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate) as indicated.
Surgical intervention: Uterine artery embolization, B-Lynch suture, hysterectomy (last resort).
Fluid resuscitation: IV crystalloids, blood transfusion. Assess Fundus: Immediately after birth and frequently. Should be firm, midline, at or below umbilicus. If boggy, massage until firm.
Assess Lochia: Quantity, color, presence of clots. Quantify blood loss accurately.
Vital Signs: Monitor every 5-15 minutes in acute hemorrhage. Recognize subtle changes.
Bladder: Ensure bladder is empty (full bladder can displace uterus and prevent contraction). Straight catheterize if needed.
IV Access: Ensure at least two large-bore (18-gauge) IVs for fluid and blood product administration.
Medication Administration: Understand mechanism of action, dosages, routes, and contraindications of uterotonics.
Emotional Support: Keep patient and family informed. Maintain a calm environment.
Team Communication: Alert provider immediately for signs of PPH. Initiate rapid response if indicated.
Post-PPH Care: Monitor for anemia, fatigue. Administer iron supplements as prescribed. Warning Signs: Educate patient on signs of excessive bleeding (e.g., soaking more than one pad per hour, large clots, dizziness).
Activity: Gradual increase in activity; avoid heavy lifting.
Nutrition: Importance of iron-rich foods to replenish stores (e.g., red meat, leafy greens, fortified cereals).
Rest: Emphasize importance of rest and sleep.
Follow-up: Stress importance of postpartum follow-up appointments.
NCLEX Tip: Teach signs of infection and when to seek immediate medical attention (e.g., fever, foul-smelling lochia).

Contact: The sensory experiences of touching, holding, and gazing at the infant are part of proximity-seeking behavior.
Emotional state: The emotional state emerges from the affective experience of the new parents toward their infant and the parental role.
Individualization: Parents are aware of the need to differentiate the infant’s needs from themselves and to recognize and respond to them appropriately, making the attachment process also, in a way, one of detachment.

Swelling, firmness, and discomfort in breasts due to increased blood flow and milk production postpartum
Commonly occurs 3–5 days after delivery
Can affect breastfeeding and cause pain or difficulty latching Sudden increase in milk volume (lactogenesis II)
Infrequent or ineffective breastfeeding or pumping
Breast milk stasis and venous/lymphatic congestion Primiparity
Delayed breastfeeding initiation
Infrequent feedings
Formula supplementation
Poor infant latch or ineffective suck Bilateral breast fullness, hardness, warmth, pain
Shiny, tight skin with flattened nipples
Low-grade fever possible (&lt; 100.4°F)
Baby may struggle to latch due to breast firmness Plugged ducts
Mastitis
Breast abscess
Breastfeeding cessation Clinical diagnosis based on symptoms and timing postpartum
Rule out mastitis if fever &gt; 100.4°F, redness, systemic symptoms Breastfeed or pump frequently (q2–3h)
Warm compresses before feeding (↑ milk flow)
Cold compresses or chilled cabbage leaves after feeding (↓ swelling)
Gentle breast massage during feeds
NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) for pain/inflammation Assess for signs of mastitis
Encourage early and frequent breastfeeding
Teach proper latch and positioning
Support hand expression if too full to latch
Monitor for maternal discomfort, fever
Document breast exam findings and interventions Engorgement is temporary and improves with regular milk removal
Breastfeed 8–12x/day; don’t skip night feedings
Use cold packs post-feed to reduce swelling
Wear supportive, non-restrictive bra
Avoid tight bras or binding (can worsen engorgement)
Contact provider if fever, redness, or flu-like symptoms occur
🧠 NCLEX Tip: Warm before, cold after. Frequent emptying prevents complications.

Opioid analgesic
Acts on CNS opioid receptors to alter pain perception and response
Class: Schedule II controlled substance Moderate to severe pain in L&amp;D
Analgesia during labor when epidural not used or contraindicated
May be used adjunctively in postpartum for severe uterine cramping
Rare use in PPH pain management (not first-line) Binds to mu-opioid receptors in CNS
Inhibits ascending pain pathways
Produces analgesia, sedation, and respiratory depression
Onset: 10–15 min IM/SC, 5 min IV
Peak: 30–60 min
Duration: 2–4 hrs MAOI use within 14 days (risk of serotonin syndrome)
Severe respiratory depression
Laboring patients if birth expected within 1–4 hrs (risk of neonatal CNS/respiratory depression)
Hypersensitivity Maternal: sedation, dizziness, hypotension, N/V, respiratory depression
Neonatal: decreased variability, CNS depression, delayed respiration if given near delivery
May cause tachycardia (metabolite normeperidine can be neurotoxic with repeated dosing) Assess pain, VS, FHR before/after admin
Monitor for sedation, hypotension, respiratory depression
Use cautiously if delivery imminent
Keep naloxone (Narcan) on hand for newborn or maternal reversal
Avoid repeated dosing — risk of normeperidine accumulation and seizures
Crosses placenta — can depress neonatal respiration, especially if administered 1–4 hrs before birth IM: 50–100 mg q3–4h PRN
IV: 25–50 mg slow push over ≥5 min
Onset is rapid IV, but duration is short — not ideal for prolonged labor pain May cause drowsiness — avoid standing or walking unassisted
Avoid other CNS depressants (alcohol, sedatives)
Report decreased fetal movement or unusual sedation
Medication will reduce pain but may not eliminate it fully
Inform that it may affect baby temporarily after birth (esp. if given close to delivery)

Abnormal or difficult labor resulting from problems with components of labor: 4 P's powers - expulsive forces
passageway
passenger or fetal development
psyche or maternal stress It is a leading cause of cesarean delivery
Umbrella Term for "failure to progress" with labor due to:
lac of progressive cervical dilation
lack of descent of fetal head
or both
POWERS
Ineffective uterine contractions (hypotonic or hypertonic) Hypertonic Uterine Dysfunction - erratic contractions; irregular, uncoordinated, ineffective =&gt; uterus never fully relaxes between contractions
treatment: sedate, analgesia, hydrate, reposition
Hypotonic Uterine Dysfunction - Contractions become poor in quality and lack sufficient intensity to dilate and efface the cervix; high risk for hemorrhage
treatment: augment via Pitocin, amniptomy to enchance labor, hydrate Protracted disorders - very slow dilation and descent
Arrest Disorders - no progress or failure of descent
Precipitate Labor - completed in 3 hours or less; "cannonball baby"
=&gt; too fast of delivery =&gt; cervical lacerations, uterine rupture
PASSENGER
Positioning =&gt; any position other than occiput anterior (head down and anterior facing) = higher risk Persistent Occiput Posterior - most common
<a data-href="Shoulder Distocia" href="ob/iii.-labor/complications/shoulder-distocia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shoulder Distocia</a> - head delivered but shoulder is blocking; EMERGENCY
=&gt; can lead to brachial plexus palsy - no nerve control, shoulder is drooping
=&gt; high risk for uterine lacerations, bleeding
=&gt; "turtling" - head of the baby emerging from the birth canal, then retracting back Multiple Gestation - twins or more (plan for vaginal birth if twins are VERTEX)
Macrosomia - 4kg or more baby
PASSAGEWAY
Pelvis Shape = "Good Anatomy Allows Passage" Gynecoid - good; best shape, round
Anthropoid - oval, "ape-like", okay for delivery
Android - "andro" =&gt; male pevis, difficult!
Platypelloid - platypus=flatl POOR FIT! obstructions of maternal birth canal - swelling of cervix
FetoPelvic Disproportion (FPD) - Fetal head is too large or pelvis is too smallPSYCHE
mom emotions =&gt; psychological stress
hormones from intense anxiety
anxiety =&gt; increased fer, tension, pain tolerance First-time pregnancy (nulliparity) Advanced maternal age Obesity Epidural anesthesia Prolonged labor Hydramnios
Short maternal status (less than 5 ft tall)
More than 8.8 lbs fetus
GA &gt;41 wks
Abnormal fetal presentation (e.g., occiput posterior, breech) Chorioamnionitis high caffeine intake
Ineffective uterine contractions
High fetal station at complete cervical dilation
note: acrocyanosis is normal
Slowed or stalled cervical dilation Lack of fetal descent despite adequate contractions Abnormal contraction patterns Maternal fatigue Fetal distress may develop Prolonged labor Fetal hypoxia or distress Uterine rupture (especially with prior C-section) Maternal infection or hemorrhage Increased likelihood of operative delivery <br><a data-href="Erb's Palsy" href="ob/v.-newborn/complications/erb's-palsy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Erb's Palsy</a> Monitor Progress of Labor - 1cm per hour dilation is standard
Physical exam to assess dilation, effacement, and fetal station Ultrasound for fetal position and estimated weight Intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) to measure contraction strength Pelvimetry in suspected CPD Amniotomy to augment labor =&gt; breaking water
Oxytocin (Pitocin) for hypotonic contractions Upright positioning - promote fetal rotation and descent; change frequently
Operative delivery (vacuum, forceps) if indicated Cesarean delivery if labor fails to progress or complications arise suprapubic bone for shoulder dystocia Monitor labor progression closely Assess fetal heart rate and uterine contraction pattern Encourage position changes and ambulation if appropriate Administer pain management and oxytocin as ordered backrubs to promote fetal rotation Explain interventions and rationale (e.g., amniotomy, oxytocin) Discuss signs of labor progress and when to alert staff Provide reassurance and emotional support Prepare patient for possible surgical delivery if needed

Methergine
Carboprost Tromethamine
TXA
Oxytocin
Misoprostol
Indications: Prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) caused by uterine atony or subinvolution.
Mechanism of Action: Directly stimulates smooth muscle of the uterus, causing rapid, sustained tetanic uterine contraction; also constricts peripheral and coronary blood vessels.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to methergine, hypertension (pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, chronic hypertension), cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease, hepatic or renal impairment, sepsis, threatened spontaneous abortion (before delivery of placenta), induction of labor.
Expected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/cramping, dizziness, headache, diaphoresis.
Adverse Effects: Severe hypertension (potentially leading to cerebral hemorrhage), seizures, palpitations, chest pain, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, stroke, allergic reactions (rash, anaphylaxis), ergotism (rare, with prolonged use or overdose: peripheral vasospasm, cyanosis, cold extremities).
Nursing Considerations: Assess blood pressure frequently (every 15 minutes or more often as indicated) during administration and for several hours afterward; monitor uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and fundal height; administer IV slowly over at least 60 seconds (rapid IV push can cause severe hypertension and cerebrovascular accident); monitor for signs of ergotism; educate patient about potential side effects and to report any severe headache, chest pain, or vision changes; typically given IM; IV is reserved for emergent situations due to risk of severe hypertension.
Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: 140/90 BP or greater; signs of severe hypertension or neurological symptoms (e.g., severe headache, visual disturbances, seizures); chest pain or signs of myocardial ischemia. Indications: Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony that is unresponsive to other oxytocic agents; used in pregnancy termination.
Mechanism of Action: Potent prostaglandin F2-alpha analog; directly stimulates sustained contraction of uterine smooth muscle; also causes contraction of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to carboprost or prostaglandins, acute pelvic inflammatory disease, active cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease, asthma (absolute contraindication due to bronchoconstriction); caution with hypertension, hypotension, anemia, jaundice, diabetes, epilepsy, previous uterine surgery (e.g., C-section).
Expected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (very common due to smooth muscle stimulation), fever, chills, flushing, headache, tachycardia.
Adverse Effects: Bronchospasm, wheezing, dyspnea, hypertension or hypotension, pulmonary edema, <a data-href="Uterine Rupture" href="ob/iii.-labor/complications/uterine-rupture.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Uterine Rupture</a> (rare, especially with overuse or in grand multiparas), uterine hypertonus, tetanic contractions, arrhythmias, <a data-href="DIC" href="med-surg/hematological/dic.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DIC</a> (disseminated intravascular coagulation, rare).
Nursing Considerations: Administer deep IM only; avoid IV administration; rotate injection sites if multiple doses are needed; monitor uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and vital signs (BP, pulse, respirations, temperature) frequently; have antiemetics and antidiarrheals readily available and consider pre-medication; auscultate lung sounds for signs of bronchospasm; assess for fever, which is a common but usually transient side effect; educate patient about common GI side effects.
Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Severe bronchospasm or respiratory distress; sustained severe hypertension or hypotension refractory to treatment; signs of uterine rupture. Indications: Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage when conservative management is insufficient; reduces blood loss in various surgical procedures and trauma.
Mechanism of Action: Antifibrinolytic agent; reversibly binds to plasminogen and plasmin, preventing fibrinolysis (breakdown of blood clots); stabilizes existing clots.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to TXA, active intravascular clotting (e.g., DIC, unless primary fibrinolysis is predominant), history of thrombosis (DVT, PE, stroke, MI), unless benefits clearly outweigh risks, severe renal impairment (dose adjustment needed), history of seizures (may increase seizure risk), color vision impairment (can mask retinal toxicity).
Expected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, hypotension (if administered too rapidly IV), abdominal pain.
Adverse Effects: Thromboembolic events (DVT, PE, stroke, MI) – although studies suggest low risk in PPH; seizures (especially with rapid IV administration or high doses); visual disturbances, impaired color vision; allergic reactions; renal cortical necrosis (rare, with prolonged use/high doses).
Nursing Considerations: Administer intravenously slowly over 10 minutes to prevent hypotension; monitor for signs of thrombosis (e.g., leg pain, swelling, chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological changes); assess for any changes in vision or color perception; monitor vital signs, uterine tone, and blood loss; ensure proper hydration; typically given within 3 hours of birth for PPH benefit.
Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Signs of active thrombosis (e.g., new onset chest pain, dyspnea, calf pain, neurological deficits); severe allergic reaction; new onset or worsening seizures; significant visual changes. Indications: Prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony; induction and augmentation of labor; to promote milk let-down (nasal spray, rare).
Mechanism of Action: Synthetic polypeptide hormone structurally identical to natural oxytocin; acts on oxytocin receptors in the uterus, causing rhythmic contractions of uterine smooth muscle; increases the frequency and intensity of contractions; also has antidiuretic effects at high doses.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to oxytocin, cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), unfavorable fetal position or presentation, significant placenta previa or vasa previa, umbilical cord prolapse, uterine hypertonicity or fetal distress when delivery is not imminent, severe toxemia, active genital herpes, undelivered placenta (before delivery of placenta in PPH management, it's typically given after delivery).
Expected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/cramping, headache, flushing.
Adverse Effects: Maternal: Uterine hyperstimulation/tetany (leading to uterine rupture, placental abruption, fetal distress), water intoxication (hyponatremia, cerebral edema, seizures, coma) with high doses and large volumes of hypotonic fluids, hypotension or hypertension (less common), arrhythmias, postpartum hemorrhage (paradoxical, if receptors are saturated or overstimulated), allergic reactions; Fetal: Fetal distress (due to uterine hyperstimulation), bradycardia, hypoxia, acidosis.
Nursing Considerations: Administer as a dilute IV infusion via a pump, typically as a piggyback into a main IV line; never administer undiluted IV push in PPH management (can cause severe hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias); monitor uterine activity (frequency, duration, intensity of contractions), uterine resting tone, and vaginal bleeding; monitor vital signs (BP, pulse) frequently; assess intake and output to monitor for water intoxication; assess for signs of uterine hyperstimulation (contractions lasting &gt;90 seconds, less than 2 minutes apart, or resting tone &gt;20 mmHg); have tocolytics (e.g., terbutaline) available to relax the uterus in case of hyperstimulation.
Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Signs of uterine hyperstimulation (contractions too frequent, too long, or resting tone too high); signs of fetal distress (if used antepartum); signs of water intoxication (e.g., hyponatremia, decreased urine output, confusion, seizures); significant maternal hypotension or arrhythmia. Indications: Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony; cervical ripening and labor induction; abortion (medical); prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers.
Mechanism of Action: Synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog; causes strong uterine contractions; also causes cervical softening and dilation.
Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to misoprostol or other prostaglandins, known allergy to other prostaglandins; in the context of PPH, generally few absolute contraindications once the baby and placenta are delivered, as it's a critical situation; however, caution in patients with glaucoma, asthma (less of a concern than carboprost but still a prostaglandin), or severe cardiovascular disease; active gastrointestinal disease (if given orally for ulcer prevention).
Expected Side Effects: Shivering, chills, fever (very common), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (common), abdominal pain/cramping, headache.
Adverse Effects: Uterine hyperstimulation/tetany (leading to uterine rupture, especially with high doses or in cases of previous uterine surgery), hypotension or hypertension, bradycardia or tachycardia, allergic reactions, bronchospasm (less common than with carboprost), DIC (rare).
Nursing Considerations: Can be administered orally, sublingually, rectally, or vaginally for PPH; rectal administration is often preferred in emergent PPH due to rapid absorption and less GI side effects; monitor uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature) frequently; anticipate and manage shivering/chills with warm blankets; provide comfort measures for nausea and vomiting; educate patient about common side effects; ensure accurate dosage and route of administration.
Specific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Sustained uterine hypertonus not responding to other measures; signs of uterine rupture; severe allergic reaction.

aka Pitocin
Synthetic hormone identical to endogenous oxytocin
stimulates uterine smooth muscle contractions
does not cross placenta
For Induction: 0.5-1 mUnit/min IV, titrate 1-2 mUnit/min q15-60min until contraction pattern reached that is similiar to normal labor
Labor induction or augmentation Management of postpartum hemorrhage Incomplete or inevitable miscarriage (to aid uterine evacuation)
Binds to oxytocin receptors in uterine smooth muscle → increases intracellular calcium → promotes rhythmic uterine contractions; also promotes milk let-down reflex via myoepithelial contraction in breasts
Fetal distress without imminent delivery Unfavorable fetal position (e.g., transverse lie) Previous uterine surgery (e.g., classical C-section or extensive myomectomy) Placenta previa or vasa previa Active genital herpes Hypertonic uterine patterns or hypersensitivity Mild hypotension Flushing Headache Nausea and vomiting Abdominal cramping Uterine hypertonicity or tachysystole Pelvic discomfort or pain Water retention or hyponatremia (due to antidiuretic properties) Restlessness or anxiety Drowsiness or confusion (in cases of water intoxication) Uterine Tachysystole: &gt;5 contractions in 10 minutes, may reduce fetal oxygenation Uterine Hypertonicity: Sustained contractions or inadequate uterine relaxation, increases risk of fetal distress Fetal Distress: Late decelerations, bradycardia, or decreased variability due to reduced placental perfusion Uterine Rupture: Especially in patients with prior uterine surgery or high-dose/prolonged use Postpartum Hemorrhage: From uterine atony following prolonged stimulation Water Intoxication/Hyponatremia: Rare but serious, due to oxytocin’s antidiuretic effect Hypotension: Especially with rapid IV bolus Nausea/Vomiting: Mild but possible GI effects Anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity: Rare, but must be monitored
High vigilance and titrated dosing are essential to minimize these risks.
Continuous fetal and contraction monitoring (risk of uterine tachysystole or fetal distress) Monitor for uterine hyperstimulation (&gt;5 contractions in 10 min or contractions lasting &gt;90 sec) Assess I&amp;O due to risk of water intoxication (oxytocin has antidiuretic effect) Titrate infusion per protocol (commonly in milliunits/min) Stop infusion and notify provider if fetal decelerations or uterine hypertonicity occur Monitor BP, HR, and uterine tone postpartum

Icommon tool for quickly getting a rough estimate of the delivery date, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy. How it Works:Start with the LMP: Identify the first day of the woman's last menstrual period.
Subtract three calendar months: Count back three full calendar months from the LMP date.
Add seven days: Add seven days to the date obtained in step 2.
Add one year (if needed): If the date falls in the previous year, add one year to the date. Example:
Let's say the first day of a woman's LMP was September 9, 2023. Subtract three months: September - 3 months = June.
Add seven days: June 9 + 7 days = June 16.
Add one year (if needed): Since the date is in the current year (2024), we don't add a year. Therefore, the estimated due date would be June 16, 2024]]></description><link>ob/i.-maternal-assessment/naegel's-rule.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">OB/i.

Indomethacin
Nifedipine
<a data-href="Terbutraline" href="pharmacology/obgyn/terbutraline.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Terbutraline</a>
Preterm labor before 34 weeks gestation with no contraindications to prolonging pregnancy To facilitate maternal transfer or corticosteroid administration Sometimes used during procedures (e.g., external cephalic version)
Varies by drug class: Beta-agonists (e.g., terbutaline): relax uterine smooth muscle via β2 stimulation Calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine): reduce calcium influx in smooth muscle NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin): inhibit prostaglandin synthesis Magnesium sulfate: decreases uterine muscle contractility (less common as first-line)
Maternal: severe preeclampsia, hemorrhage, cardiac disease, infection
Fetal: intrauterine fetal demise, lethal anomaly, non-reassuring fetal status, gestational age &gt;34 weeks
Maternal Hypotension: SBP &lt;90 mmHg or symptomatic hypotension (especially for nifedipine) Maternal Tachycardia: HR &gt;120–130 bpm (common with beta-agonists like terbutaline) Maternal Respiratory Depression: RR &lt;12/min or signs of distress (critical for magnesium sulfate use) Fever: Maternal temp &gt;38°C (100.4°F), suggestive of chorioamnionitis Oxygen Saturation: SpO₂ &lt;95% or signs of hypoxia Fetal Distress: Non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns (e.g., persistent late decelerations) Uterine Findings: Uterine infection, abruption, or evidence of fetal compromise
Additional labs or findings to monitor: Elevated WBC + uterine tenderness: Suggestive of infection Abnormal LFTs or platelets: Especially relevant in severe preeclampsia/HELLP Signs of cardiac instability: Especially with beta-agonists or underlying maternal heart disease Monitor maternal VS (especially HR, BP, respiratory status) Assess fetal status via continuous monitoring Watch for side effects (e.g., tachycardia with terbutaline, hypotension with nifedipine, GI issues with indomethacin) Educate patient on signs of labor and medication side effects Ensure corticosteroids are administered if under 34 weeks Monitor fluid balance, especially with magnesium sulfate

Indication: Medical abortion, cervical ripening, postpartum hemorrhage
Mechanism: Prostaglandin E1 analog — stimulates uterine contractions and cervical softening
Nursing Implications: Monitor for uterine cramping and bleeding
Assess for complete expulsion in medical abortion
Educate on expected side effects (e.g., chills, fever, diarrhea, N/V, dyspepsia)
Monitor for signs and symptoms of shock, such as tachycardia, hypotension, and anxiety. Indication: Medical abortion (often combined with misoprostol)
Mechanism: Progesterone receptor antagonist — blocks progesterone, leading to decidual breakdown and detachment of pregnancy
Nursing Implications: Monitor for headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and heavy bleeding.
Anticipate administration of antiemetic prior to use to reduce nausea and vomiting.
Encourage client to use acetaminophen to reduce discomfort from cramping. Indication: Cervical ripening and labor induction
Mechanism: Prostaglandin E2 analog — promotes cervical softening and stimulates uterine contractions
Administration: gel form, warm it first, sterile technique, lie supine for 30 minutes
Nursing Implications: Monitor fetal heart rate and uterine activity continuously
Remove insert if uterine tachysystole occurs
Educate on potential side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
Sterile technique, supine position for 30 minutes after admin Indication: Prevention of Rh alloimmunization in Rh-negative mothers
Mechanism: Passive immunization — binds Rh-positive fetal cells in maternal circulation to prevent immune response
Nursing Implications: Confirm mother’s Rh-negative status and absence of sensitization
Administer at 28 weeks and within 72 hours postpartum (or after procedures like amniocentesis)
Educate mother on purpose and timing of administration ]]></description><link>pharmacology/obgyn/abortion-medications.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pharmacology/ObGyn/Abortion Medications.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 02:00:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Continuous Fetal Monitoring]]></title><description><![CDATA[Chapter 13 - Ricci Text book
provides information on fetal oxygenation during labor
goal: detect FHR changes early before they are prolonged
can be internal or external two ultrasound transducers, each of which is attached to a belt, are applied around the woman’s abdomen Tocotransducer - placed over the uterine fundus in the area of greatest contractility to monitor uterine contractions Other transducer - baseline FHR, long-term variability, accelerations, and decelerations placed midline between the umbilicus and the symphysis pubis Pros Noninvasive
Can be used before ROM (membranes intact)
Quick to apply
No risk of uterine perforation or infection
Detects FHR baseline, variability, accelerations, and decelerations
good continuous data Cons limits maternal movement, encourage supine positioning =&gt; reduces placental perfusion
Less accurate FHR detection in obese women
May pick up maternal heart rate artifact
Cannot measure uterine contraction intensity—only frequency and duration
May need frequent repositioning due to fetal/maternal movement
Less reliable in multiples (twins, etc.) for higher risk labor: multiple gestation, decreased fetal movement, abnormal FHR, <a data-href="Preeclampsia" href="ob/ii.-pregnancy/high-risk/hypertensive-disorders/preeclampsia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Preeclampsia</a>, etc spiral electrode into the fetal presenting part, usually the parietal bone on the head pressure transducer placed internally within the uterus to record uterine contractions Pros More accurate FHR detection; less artifact
Measures true uterine contraction intensity with IUPC
Not affected by maternal position or movement
Directly records beat-to-beat variability Cons Requires ROM (artificial or spontaneous)
Requires cervical dilation ≥2 cm
Invasive—risk of infection and uterine perforation
Contraindicated in cases of placenta previa, herpes, HIV, hepatitis
Potential fetal injury from electrode placement CRITERIA FOR INTERNAL MONITORING:
Ruptured membranes
Cervical dilation ≥2 cm
Presenting part engaged (not floating)
No maternal infections (e.g., HIV, herpes)
Skilled provider available

1 second = 1 mm ÷ (3 cm/min) = 0.2 cm/sec So, every 1 mm (small box) on the paper = 10 seconds 6 small boxes (1 cm) = 60 seconds / 1 minute A 10-minute strip is typically 30 cm long
1 Red Line Divider = 1 minute
1 small box = 10 secondsCategory I: Normal
Baseline rate: 110–160 bpm
Baseline variability: moderate (6–25 bpm)
No late or variable decelerations
Early decelerations: present or absent
Accelerations: present or absent
→ Indicates normal fetal acid-base status; no intervention needed.
Category II: Indeterminate
Includes any tracing not categorized as I or III
Examples: Bradycardia with variability
Tachycardia
Minimal, absent, or marked variability
Absence of accelerations after stimulation
Recurrent variable decels with minimal/moderate variability
→ Requires close monitoring and clinical evaluation. Category III: Abnormal - LV "luis vitton" =&gt; late &amp; variable decels
Absent variability and any of the following: Recurrent late decelerations
Recurrent variable decelerations
Bradycardia Sinusoidal pattern
→ Indicates abnormal fetal acid-base status; requires prompt intervention (e.g., oxygen, repositioning, delivery if unresolved). Fluctuations in the baseline FHR that are irregular in amplitude and frequency
Reflects the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems
Key indicator of fetal well-being
1. Absent
No detectable fluctuations
May indicate fetal hypoxia, acidosis, or neurologic depression
Concerning—requires immediate evaluation
prepare for emergency delivery
2. Minimal
Amplitude range: ≤5 bpm
Causes: sleep cycle, sedation (e.g., opioids, magnesium sulfate), prematurity, or hypoxia
Evaluate context and other FHR patterns
3. Moderate (Normal)
Amplitude range: 6–25 bpm
Indicates well-oxygenated fetus with intact CNS
Most reassuring variability
4. Marked
Amplitude: &gt;25 bpm
Causes: acute hypoxia, fetal stimulation, or cord compression
May be transient but warrants monitoring
Moderate variability = reassuring
Absent/minimal = concerning when persistent, especially with decels or bradycardia
Marked = assess for cause, monitor for fetal stress1. Early Decelerations
Cause: Head compression (normal response during contractions)
Timing: Mirrors the contraction; nadir aligns with peak
Appearance: Gradual onset/return, uniform shape
Significance: still type 1!, benign, usually not concerning
2. Variable Decelerations
Cause: Umbilical cord compression
Timing: Abrupt onset; varies in timing with contractions
Appearance: Sharp drop (V, U, or W shaped), quick recovery
Significance: May require intervention if recurrent or severe
3. Late Decelerations
Cause: Uteroplacental insufficiency (e.g., hypoxia, hypertension, post-dates)
Timing: Begins after contraction starts; nadir after peak
Appearance: Gradual onset/return
Significance: Concerning—indicates fetal distress, requires evaluation and possible intervention
Late decels = LIONS (L → Left side, I → IV fluids, O → Oxygen, N → Notify provider, S → Stop oxytocin)
4. Prolonged Decelerations
Cause: Interruption in fetal oxygen (e.g., cord prolapse, hypotension, uterine rupture)
Timing: Lasts 2–10 minutes
Appearance: Sharp drop, sustained
Significance: Emergent—requires prompt evaluation and action

Original 5 P's
Passageway
Passenger
Powers
Position
Psychological Response birth canal
Pelvis: must be at least 11.5 cm diagonal conjugate, true conjugate 10cm or more
Soft Tissues: must efface (thin out)
Pelvic Floor muscles =&gt; help rotate fetus during labor (Kegels!)
Pelvic Shapes:
Gynecoid - "G for Good", best, round shape, roomy outlet
Anthropoid - "Anthro = average", not ideal but better than ANDROID or PLATYPELLOID
Android - "male robot = male pelvis"; funnel shape, not good, usually C-section
Platypelloid (flat) - least common, not good
HEAD
largest part
cranial sutures &amp; soft fontanelle = &gt;help head elongate with pressure
overlapping sutures = molding; elongated
Caput succedaneum - edema of the scalp at the presenting part (resolves in 3-4 days)
Cephalohematoma - Collection of blood between the periosteum and the bone that occurs several hours after birth.
Fetal Attitude posturing or FLEXION or EXTESION of joints
FULL FLEXION - good; more compressed body
FETAL LIE - relationship of long spin to spine of motherLIE to LTO
longitudinal - parallel to maternal spine
transverse oblique - fetal long axis is at an angle to the bony inlet
FETAL PRESENTATION - part that is peeking out of the vajayjay
Cephalic - head first; more common
1. Vertex - occipital lobe first; most preferred
2. Military
3. Brow - Largest diameter presents; labor often does not progress; usually requires C-section
4. Face - May cause facial edema, bruising; larger presenting diameter makes vaginal delivery challenging.
Breech - pelvis first; umbilical cord can compress; largest part last; risk for birth trauma, head entrapment, often c-section
Frank Breech - baby's legs are straight up in front, with the feet near the head, and the buttocks present first.
Complete - knees bent
Single Footling - one foot down
Double Footling - two feet down
Shoulder - scapula first; risk for <a data-href="Shoulder Distocia" href="ob/iii.-labor/complications/shoulder-distocia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Shoulder Distocia</a>, cannot be delivered vaginally; high risk of cord prolapse; requires C-section.
TURTLE SIGN - neonate’s head slowly extends and emerges over the perineum but then retracts back
FETAL POSITION - position in the womb j described by the baby’s head, back, and limbs relative to the mother’s pelvisJay Loa &amp; Roa = baby's most favorable positionLeft Occiput Anterior (LOA)- most favorable
Right Occiput Anterior (ROA) - 2nd most favorable
Posterior (xOP)- least favorable
L or R - left or right
O/S/M/A/D - Occupit, Sacrum, Mentum, Acrominion, Dorsal
A/P/T - anterior, posterior, transverse
FETAL STATION - relationship of the presenting part to the level of the maternal pelvic ischial spines
scale of -4 not +4
-4 not engage, +4 crowning, ready to delivery
0 stations - head aligned with ischial spine in pelvis, considered as "engaged"
FETAL ENGAGEMENT - largest diameter of the fetal presenting partCARDINAL MOVEMENTS OF LABOR - EDFIREEE
Engagement Fetal head enters pelvic inlet (0 station) Indicates head is engaged and labor is progressing normally Descent Head moves deeper into pelvis with contractions and maternal effort Indicates progression toward delivery; continued descent is necessary for successful vaginal birth Flexion Fetal chin tucks to chest, presenting the smallest diameter Allows for easier passage through the pelvis Internal Rotation Head rotates to align with the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvis Proper rotation reduces risk of prolonged labor and aids in head alignment for delivery Extension Fetal head extends as it passes under the pubic symphysis Facilitates delivery of the head; guides provider to prepare for crowning External Rotation (Restitution) Head realigns with shoulders after head is delivered Allows shoulders to align with pelvis; prepares for shoulder delivery Expulsion Shoulders and body are delivered Marks the completion of delivery and transition to newborn care UTERINE CONTRACTIONS - involuntary; responsible for thinning and dilating cervix
Effacement - % based on cervical canal length
2 cm = 0%
1 cm = 50%
0 cm = 100%. Dilation
Frequency &amp; Duration: early labor =&gt; 30 sections, 5-7 minutes apart
Intensity - measured by internal intrauterine pressure catheter
Contraction Phase:
increment - start to peak
acme - actual peak
decrement - peak to baseline; relaxation of the uterine muscle fibers
INTRA-ABDOMINAL PRESSURE - caused by voluntary muscle contractions
more pressure, the better expulsion
sedation decreases upright maternal positioning uses gravity to bring fetus down, less risk of aorta compression
common practice - adopt maternal position of comfort
peanut ball can decrease time of labor more emotional support = better

onset - within minutes and lasts for several hours
complication: respiratory depression
Opioids: morphine, demerol, fentanyl can cross placenta Antiemetics: hydroxyzine, promethazine, Compazine
Benzodiazepines
Midazolam/Versed - amnesia effect, adjunct for anesthesia
Diazepam - enhance pain relief, sedation
Inhaled Analgesics - nitrous oxide, self-administered =&gt; empowering, less perception of pain local anesthetic agents with or without added opioids to bring about pain relief or numbness through the drug’s effects on the spinal cord and nerve roots
pain relief without loss of consciousness
usually T8 to T10
The woman can participate in the birthing process and still have good pain control administration of opioids or anesthetics into the epidural or intrathecal space
small catheter is then passed through the epidural needle
Epidural analgesia increases the duration of the second stage of labor
meds: combination of lidocaine anesthetic, opioid analgesic
Contraindication: receiving anticoagulants indwelling epidural catheter with an infusion of medication and a programmed pump allows patient controlled dosing injection of local anesthetic into the superficial perineal nerves to numb the perineal area injection of a local anesthetic agent into the pudendal nerves near each ischial spine
provides pain relief in the lower vagina, vulva, and perineum injection of an anesthetic “caine” agent with or without opioids into the subarachnoid space
usually used in c-sections
contraindications: bleeding precautions
intrathecal narcotics state of unconsciousness and insensitivity to pain during surgery
Usually: barbiturate + propofol (unconsciousness) + muscle relaxant
crosses placenta
Complications: fetal depression, uterine relaxation, vomiting/aspiration, inability to intubate
Considerations: ensure NPO, IV line, administer clear oral antacid or <a data-href="PPI and H2 Blockers" href="pharmacology/gi-meds/ppi-and-h2-blockers.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">PPI and H2 Blockers</a>

Bradycardia
below 110
Causes: hypoxia, prolonged maternal hypoglycemia, fetal acidosis, administration of analgesic drugs to the mother, hypothermia, anesthetic agents (epidural), maternal hypotension, fetal hypothermia, prolonged umbilical cord compression, and fetal congenital heart block
Tachycardia:
greater than 160
Causes: hypoxia, maternal fever, maternal dehydration, amnionitis, drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine), maternal hyperthyroidism, maternal anxiety, fetal anemia, prematurity, fetal infection, chronic hypoxemia, congenital anomalies, fetal heart failure, and fetal arrhythmias
Can be an ominous sign if it is accompanied by a decrease in variability and late decelerations clinical indicator that is predictive of fetal acid–base balance and cerebral tissue perfusion
Key indicator of fetal well-being
1. Absent
No detectable fluctuations
May indicate fetal hypoxia, acidosis, or neurologic depression
Concerning—requires immediate evaluation
prepare for emergency delivery
2. Minimal
Amplitude range: ≤5 bpm
Causes: sleep cycle, sedation (e.g., opioids, magnesium sulfate), prematurity, or hypoxia
Evaluate context and other FHR patterns
3. Moderate (Normal)
Amplitude range: 6–25 bpm
Indicates well-oxygenated fetus with intact CNS
Most reassuring&nbsp;variability
4. Marked
Amplitude: &gt;25 bpm Causes: acute hypoxia, fetal stimulation, or cord compression May be transient but warrants monitoring ]]></description><link>ob/iii.-labor/assessments-fetal/fhr-patterns.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">OB/iii.

Periodic assessment of fetal heart rate (FHR) using handheld Doppler or fetoscope
Uses ultrasound waves to detect fetal heart echoes
Acceptable for low-risk laboring women
Promotes mobility and physiologic birth Allows maternal mobility during labor
Less restrictive than continuous EFM
Encourages natural labor progression Cannot detect variability or types of decelerations
Does not provide a continuous record of fetal status
May miss transient or late decelerations Use Leopold maneuvers to locate fetal back
Apply water-soluble gel to abdomen
Place Doppler in lower abdominal quadrant (cephalic) or umbilicus level (breech)
Palpate maternal radial pulse to differentiate from maternal HR
Baseline FHR: auscultate for 1 minute after contraction
Routine checks: 30 seconds x 2 (if no changes) Initial: 10-20 min continuous FHR upon admission
Low-risk active labor: q30min
High-risk active labor: q15min
Second stage low-risk: q15min
Second stage high-risk: q5min
Assess FHR before and after vaginal exams, ROM, meds, ambulation Monitor FHR after position changes, pain meds, or other interventions
FHR may shift location as fetus descends
Not recommended for undiagnosed high-risk labor
Safe for low-risk women with no evidence of fetal compromise
Does not replace continuous monitoring for high-risk cases Late decels: best detected by listening at end of contraction
Chorioamnionitis: monitor for maternal fever &amp; fetal tachycardia
Document: FHR baseline, rhythm, rate, and maternal VS
For low-risk patients, no difference in Apgar or outcomes vs. continuous EFM

Amniotic fluid analysis involves assessing fluid obtained from ruptured membranes (spontaneous or artificial) during labor
Helps evaluate fetal well-being, infection, and labor progression Confirm membrane rupture
Assess fetal lung maturity (if indicated, but usually done antenatally)
Evaluate infection risk (chorioamnionitis)
Identify meconium presence (fetal distress) Color
Clear/slightly cloudy: normal
Greenish/brown: meconium-stained → possible fetal distress or post-term
Yellow: hemolytic disease (Rh incompatibility)
Red: possible abruption or bleeding
Odor
Foul smell = chorioamnionitis (infection)
Volume Oligohydramnios: &lt;500 mL at term → risk of cord compression, growth restriction Polyhydramnios: &gt;2000 mL at term → risk of prolapsed cord, preterm labor
pH/Nitrazine test pH &gt; 6.5 = amniotic fluid (alkaline)
Vaginal secretions = acidic (pH 4.5–5.5) Ferning test Microscopic exam shows fern pattern → confirms rupture of membranes Leukocytes Elevated WBC (&gt;30/mm³) → infection Nitrazine paper turns blue if fluid is alkaline (ruptured membranes)
Fern test: Dry fluid on slide → microscopic fern-like crystals
Meconium-stained fluid = fetal stress; may need neonatal resuscitation
Cloudy, foul-smelling fluid = possible infection → start antibiotics Explain procedure and obtain informed consent if needed
Use sterile gloves when collecting samples to prevent infection
Document color, odor, amount, and time of rupture
Monitor for infection: maternal fever, fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness
Notify provider immediately if meconium is present → risk of meconium aspiration syndrome
Prepare for neonatal resuscitation if meconium-stained fluid
Teach patient to report changes in color, odor, or amount of fluid
Reinforce hand hygiene and peri-care after fluid leaks Prolonged rupture (&gt;18 hours) → increased risk of infection → monitor for chorioamnionitis
Yellow fluid → think Rh hemolytic disease
Always confirm ferning test before assuming membranes have ruptured
Blue Nitrazine paper alone can yield false positives (e.g., blood, semen) → confirm with ferning test

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a common bacterial colonizer of the lower GI and genitourinary tracts in women, often asymptomatic.
In pregnancy, GBS can be passed to the newborn during labor/delivery, potentially causing serious infections. Natural colonization by Streptococcus agalactiae in the vaginal or rectal area
Not sexually transmitted, but may ascend during labor Previous infant with GBS disease
GBS bacteriuria during current pregnancy
Preterm labor (&lt;37 weeks)
Prolonged rupture of membranes (&gt;18 hours)
Maternal fever during labor (&gt;100.4°F or 38°C) Maternal: Often asymptomatic
Neonate: Sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, lethargy, poor feeding, respiratory distress Neonatal sepsis or meningitis
Preterm labor
Fetal demise (in rare severe cases)
Increased neonatal morbidity/mortality if untreated Vaginal and rectal swab culture between 36–37 weeks gestation
Urine culture if GBS bacteriuria suspected earlier in pregnancy Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) during labor Penicillin G is the first-line treatment
Alternatives include ampicillin or cefazolin (if penicillin allergic without anaphylaxis risk)
Clindamycin if allergic with high anaphylaxis risk and sensitivity confirmed Ensure GBS culture is obtained at 36–37 weeks
Review GBS status upon admission to labor and delivery
Administer antibiotics at least 4 hours prior to delivery when possible
Monitor mother and infant for signs of infection
Educate on importance of IAP for GBS-positive women GBS is common and not harmful to the mother in most cases
Prophylactic antibiotics during labor protect the baby
No treatment is needed before labor unless GBS bacteriuria is present
GBS status should be communicated to all care providers during delivery planning

Rh-negative pregnant women with potential exposure to Rh-positive fetal blood After miscarriage, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or trauma Postpartum if baby is Rh-positive After procedures like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling
RhoGAM contains anti-D antibodies that destroy any fetal Rh-positive red blood cells in the mother's bloodstream before her immune system can react and form permanent antibodies.
Rh-positive individuals Already sensitized (positive indirect Coombs test) Allergy to human immunoglobulin or components of the product Confirm mother is Rh-negative and not already sensitized Administer IM, usually at 28 weeks and within 72 hours postpartum Monitor for allergic reactions Verify correct timing and dose based on event (e.g., delivery, trauma) Explain purpose is to protect future pregnancies RhoGAM does not harm the current baby Report signs of allergic reaction (e.g., rash, difficulty breathing) Importance of receiving RhoGAM after each potential Rh exposure

Nausea and vomiting
progesterone preserves the uterus but causes several side effectsIncrease in blood volume (50% above prepregnancy levels)
Anemia =&gt; large volume expansion with small increase in RBC, hemodilution
Increase in cardiac output; increased venous return; increased heart rate
BP - slight decrease until midpregnancy, then returning to prepregnancy levelsIncrease in iron demands, fibrin and plasma fibrinogen levels, and some clotting factors, leading to hypercoagulable state
Breathing more diaphragmatic than abdominal due to increase in diaphragmatic excursion, chest circumference, and tidal volume
oxygen needs increase for fetus placenta and maternal organs
increased oxygen demand and structural changes raise risk of decompensation in women with respiratory conditions
estrogen-driven vascular congestion leads to nasal stuffiness, epistaxis, rhinitis, and voice changes

Early contraction =&gt; lead to preterm birth not to be confused with Braxton Hicks contractions =&gt; stop with rest or sleep and are usually felt in the abdomen, not the lower back Signs of preterm labor: contractions every 10 minutes or more frequently, vaginal discharge changes, pelvic pressure, cramps, low backache, and diarrhea.
Early detection is crucial, as medications can sometimes stop labor if cervical dilation hasn't progressed.
If symptoms arise =&gt;lie on her left side, drink 2–3 glasses of water, and monitor for 1 hour—if symptoms persist or worsen, she should contact her provider.

This can lead to low birth weight and may increase the risk of complications during labor and delivery.
Placental insufficiency (most common cause) Maternal hypertension or pre-eclampsia Chronic maternal illness (e.g., diabetes, kidney disease) Infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella) Substance abuse (e.g., smoking, alcohol, drugs) Multiple gestation (twins or higher-order multiples) Genetic abnormalities (e.g., chromosomal disorders) Poor maternal nutrition Uterine anomalies Hypertension (pre-eclampsia or chronic hypertension) Obesity or underweight Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets) Advanced maternal age (&gt;35 years) Smoking or substance abuse Inadequate prenatal care History of FGR in previous pregnancies Small for gestational age (SGA) on ultrasound Increased fundal height discrepancy Decreased fetal movement (late sign) Ultrasound measurements (growth scans) reveal that the fetus is smaller than expected for gestational age Oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) Preterm birth Stillbirth Neonatal hypoglycemia Respiratory distress syndrome Meconium aspiration Neonatal infection Long-term developmental issues Increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in later life Ultrasound (most accurate tool for diagnosing FGR) Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow in the umbilical artery Biophysical profile (BPP) or Non-stress test (NST) to monitor fetal well-being Amniotic fluid index (AFI) to check for oligohydramnios Symphysis fundal height measurement (to assess for discrepancies) Maternal management (control underlying conditions like hypertension or diabetes) Early delivery if FGR is severe or if fetal distress is observed Increased prenatal visits for close monitoring of fetal growth Steroid therapy to accelerate fetal lung maturity if preterm delivery is anticipated Monitor fetal movements and educate the mother on how to do so (e.g., "count-to-ten" method) Educate on signs of preterm labor and when to seek medical care Monitor maternal health (e.g., blood pressure, weight, urine for protein) Support maternal nutrition (adequate caloric intake, balanced diet) Encourage cessation of smoking and avoid alcohol and drugs Prepare for potential early delivery and complications Signs of FGR: Decreased fetal movements or small abdomen Importance of prenatal visits for early detection and monitoring Nutrition: Ensure a balanced, nutritious diet to support fetal growth Smoking cessation and avoiding alcohol/substance abuse Understand fetal monitoring techniques (e.g., NST, BPP) Discuss delivery plans if early induction or cesarean section is needed

measured n number of weeks
pregnancy duration is 40 weeks from time of fertilization = 9 months or 266-280 days
Stages of Human Development:
Zygotic Stage - fertilization of sperm and egg through the second week.
Blastocyst Stage - Zygote divides into a solid ball of cells which attaches to the uterus. outer layer of cells around the blastocyst is known as trophoblast (eventually becomes the placenta)
inner cells of the blastocyst form the fetus Embryonic Stage - major organs and structures begin to emerge begins at Day 15 to week 8
Amniotic sac = maintians body temp of fetus, cushion, promote fetal movement
oligohydramnios - &lt;500 ml, low amniotic fluid volume =&gt; high risk of surgical birth, low BW infant
hydramnios - &gt;2000ml, associated with maternal diabetes, neural tube defects, chromosomal deviations, etc Fetal Stage - differentiation and structures specialize by end of the eighth week until birth HCG - Human Chroionic Gonadotropin a hormone that ensures that the endometrium will be receptive to the implanting embryo.
signals corpus lutem not to degenerate until placenta secretes adequate hormones
present 3 days after conception
Placenta - develops at end of 2nd week, complete by week 12
protects fetus from immune attack by mother
removes waste, regulates hormones
depends on maternal BP =&gt; impaired function if there is obstruction of blood
Serving as the interface between the mother and fetus
Making hormones to control the physiology of the mother to ensure fetus is supplied with nutrients and oxygen needed for growth
Inducing the mother to bring more food to the placenta
Producing hormones that mature into fetal organs
Causes of Decreased Placental Blood Flow:
Vasoconstriction or hypertension – maternal blood vessels constrict due to chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, smoking, or drug use (e.g., cocaine), reducing uteroplacental perfusion Decreased maternal blood pressure or cardiac output – maternal hypotension, cardiac disease, hemorrhage, epidural-induced hypotension, or shock reduce overall blood volume and delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the placenta Supine hypotension – gravid uterus compresses inferior vena cava when mother lies flat, decreasing venous return and cardiac output, leading to reduced placental perfusion =&gt; have mom lay on the side Excessive maternal exercise – prolonged intense activity diverts blood flow to skeletal muscles and away from uterus and placenta, transiently decreasing oxygen and nutrient delivery to the fetus
Decreased blood flow to fetus:
intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or small for gestational age infant (IGA) weighs less than the 10th percentile for gestational age due to prolonged reduction in placental blood flow, leading to lower birth weight and potential long-term health effects Placental Barrier - fetal tissues that prevent the fetus and mother's blood from mixing
Human Chorionic gonadotropin – preserves corpus luteum and progesterone, to maintain endometrium, basis of pregnancy tests Prolactin – regulates insulin production and sensitivity, supports lactation Human placental lactogen – modulates metabolism, develops maternal breasts, decreases insulin sensitivity to increase fetal nutrition Estrogen – enlarges breasts, uterus, genitalia, stimulates myometrial contractility Progesterone – maintains endometrium, decreases uterine contractility, stimulates metabolism and breast development, nourishes early conceptus Relaxin – vasodilates, regulates hemodynamics, works with progesterone, maintains pregnancy, relaxes pelvic ligaments, softens cervix for birth has unique shunts and vessels that close after birth
lung finish developing after birth; fetal lungs are nonfunctional
placenta functions as lungs =&gt; oxygenation and gas exchange
fetal liver - non functioning
Only brain and heart is maintained by fetus
liver &amp; lungs = &gt; maintained by placenta
3 Important Shunts
Ductus venosus — bypasses the liver and connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava. short cut of the liver
goes from umbilical vein directly to IVC Ductus arteriosus — bypasses the lungs and connects the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta.
Foramen ovale — bypasses the right ventricle and lungs via an anatomic opening between the right and left atrium. =&gt; aka hole in the middle of the heart Umbilicus - 2 arteries, 1 VeinAt birth:
foramen ovale closes with 1-2 hours, permanent closure by 6 months
ductus venosus (links IVC with umbilical vein) - closes with clamping of umbilicus
ductus arteriosus - closes within 72 hours after birth, permanent closure at 3-4 weeks (delayed closure results in innocent or functional murmur)
L/S Ratio - helps determine lung maturity (amino only), not used as muchFormed from the amnion
Lifeline from the mother to the growing embryo
Contains one large vein and two small arteries
Wharton jelly surrounds the vein and arteries to prevent compression
At term, the average umbilical cord is 22 in long and about 1 in wideFunctions:
Maintain steady thermal environment
Cushion against trauma
Source of oral fluid
Allows the infant freedom of movementVariable decelerations may be present if there is not enough fluidFormed from:
Diffusion of fluids from maternal blood
Fetal urine
Fetus swallows amniotic fluid
Fetus breathes amniotic fluid
Plays a role in lung maturation
Normal volume is 800-1200 ml by term
Oligohydrominos "oligo" - too little amnio, &lt;500 ml
Polyhydraminos = too much &gt;2000 ml (might have kidney issues, check with US then check after delivery)no need to memorize critical periods of embryonic development]]></description><link>ob/ii.-pregnancy/ch.10-fetal-development.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">OB/ii.

thoracentesis - Removal of fluid or air from around the lung.
US Thoracentesis - can be at the bedside, w/ or w/o ultrasound guidance Bloody fluid = trauma
milky fluid - effusion has been sitting there a long time
purulent - infection
Fluid Analysis =&gt; determine if a transudate or exudative effusion is present. Thoracoscopy - insertion of a thin tube with a camera into the pleural space to evaluate the pleural space and take samples of the lung tissue and lymph nodes. ​​​​​​​
Treat Cause: abx for infection, if HF =&gt; diuretics, nitroglycerin, PE =&gt; anticoagluants
Pleurodesis - procedure that aims to eliminate the pleural space, the area between the lungs and chest wall, by making the two layers of the pleura (the membrane lining the lungs and chest wall) stick together. This is done to prevent the accumulation of fluid or air in the pleural space,
Surgical Pleurectomy or Pleuroperitoneal Shunt Insertion - small catheter attached to a drainage bottle is inserted into the effusion. The client’s treatment can be managed on an outpatient basis.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome =&gt; occurs after 7 days of a triggering event
results in pulmonary artery vasoconstriction =&gt; pulmonary hypertension
life threatening and requires ventilation!
Key Differences Between regular pneumonia:
ARDS:
can be infections or non infectious (PNA is caused by infection)
rapid onset
widespread alveolar damage (PNA is localized)
treated with supportive care only (PNA is antibiotics + supportive)
higher mortality of 30-40% Injury Trigger: Direct (e.g. pneumonia, aspiration) or indirect (e.g. sepsis, trauma) lung injury causes inflammation Alveolar-Capillary Damage: Inflammatory mediators damage alveolar-capillary membrane → increased permeability Fluid Leak: Protein-rich fluid leaks into alveoli → pulmonary edema Impaired Gas Exchange: Edema + collapsed alveoli (atelectasis) → ↓ surfactant, ↓ compliance, severe hypoxemia Ventilation-Perfusion Mismatch: Poor oxygenation despite oxygen therapy (refractory hypoxemia) Progression: Can lead to fibrotic lung changes and multi-organ failure if not reversed
BERLIN DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (all 4 must be met):
Timing - Within 1 week of clinical insult or new/worsening respiratory symptoms
Chest Imaging - Bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules
Origin of Edema: Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload
Objective assessment (e.g., echo) needed if no clear risk factor Oxygenation (on PEEP ≥5 cm H₂O)
Mild ARDS: PaO₂/FiO₂ 200–300 mmHg
Moderate ARDS: PaO₂/FiO₂ 100–200 mmHg
Severe ARDS: PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤100 mmHg
Sepsis =&gt; MOST COMMON CAUSE

Severe cases: somnolent, cyanosis, diaphoresis
NOTE SIGNATURE MANIFESTATION: DOES NOT RESPOND TO OXYGENATION!
Somnolent - reduced level of consciousness that is described as lethargic or drowsy
muscle wasting - due to inactivity, patients are too SOB to do anything
weight loss
Functional Impairment - due to decreased mobility, atrophy, weakness
Cognitive loss - caused by brain hypoxia
Dependency on: g-tube for nutrition, new tracheostomy

Berlin Criteria for ARDS: onset occurring within 7 days of an event
non-cardiac origin
imaging indicating bilateral lung infiltrates
specific abnormal oxygenation measurements (PaO/FiO ratio of less than 300 mm Hg to confirm the diagnosis)
Other Diagnostic Tools: ABG
PaO2/Fio2 - less than 300 mm Hg (normal range is over 400 =&gt; note that this is a ratio!)
FiO2 &amp; PaO2 =&gt; determines severity of ARDS (mild, moderate, severe)

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) - broad term involving arteries in heart leading to: either Chronic Stable Angina or ACS CAD = CSA or ACSChronic Stable Angina - predictable chest pain during exertion, resolves with rest or nitroglycerin, can progress to unstable
ECG: Normal at rest; ST depression or T wave inversion during stress
Cardiac Biomarkers: normal
Treatment: Lifestyle changes, nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, statins
Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)
sudden, life-threatening condition caused by a sudden reduction in blood flow to the heart
Umbrella term for UA (unstable angina), NSTEMI, and STEMI
ACS = STEMI / NSTEMI / UASTEMI - ischemia causing full-thickness myocardial infarction
cardiac biomarkers: elevated troponin, CK-MB
Treatment: Emergency PCI or thrombolysis, MONA (morphine, oxygen, nitrates, aspirin).
NSTEMI - ischemia with myocardial infarction but without full-thickness injury
caused by- spasm of artery, stable plaque, a cardiac embolism, or arteritis and injury to the heart
similar to UA but more severe and prolonged, unrelieved by rest or nitroglycerin
Cardiac Biomarkers: Elevated (troponin, CK-MB).
Treatment: Same as UA with emphasis on revascularization (PCI).
Unstable Angina (UA)- ischemia without myocardial infarction, cardiac markers are NOT elevated.
Occurs at rest, increasing frequency/severity, lasts &gt;20 minutes, unrelieved by nitroglycerin.
Treatment: Antiplatelets (aspirin), anticoagulants, beta-blockers, nitrates, PCI if high risk.
Terms to note:
Infarction - tissue death or necrosis caused by prolonged lack of blood supply
Ischemia - reduced cardiac tissue perfusion, can progress to infarction if unresolvedMiscellaneous Things to note:
Prinzmetal angina (vasospastic angina or variant angina) - chest discomfort or pain at rest with transient ECG changes in the ST segment, and with a prompt response to nitroglycerin
Atherosclerosis - plaques that narrow or occlude blood flow to coronary arteries, decreasing perfusion
oxygen and nutrient demand outpace supply then causes pain
hypertension, having a sedentary lifestyle, using tobacco or smoking, and by having insulin resistance or diabetes
Non modifiable Risk Factors: Age (45 men, 55 women), Sex, Family history/genetics, race/ethnicity (higher w non-Hispanic white individuals)
Modifiable risk factors: inactivity, poor sleep, vaping/tobacco, obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, stress
Comorbidities: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, thyroid disease, dm, depression, obesity, gout, cancer Chest discomfort or angina (only when demand is greater than supply)
pain can radiate to the left arm, the neck, jaw, or back
diaphoresis, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, SOB, lightheadedness, and weakness
females may not experience chest pain (may present with extreme fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, and pressure in the chest)
Cardiac Biomarkers - detect heart muscle damage
Troponin - peaks in 24-48 hours, protein found in heart muscle, detects myocardial injury, elevated in NSTEMI, STEMI
Creatine Kinase-MB - elevated; enzyme found in the heart muscle, indicates MI
B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) - Primarily used to r/o HF and assess the severity of volume overload or cardiac stress.
C-Reactive Protein (CRP)- Measures inflammation levels; Non-specific, but often elevated in CAD &amp; ACS
Lipoprotein - LDL, HDL (see <a data-href="Lipid Panel" href="foundations/labs/lipid-panel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lipid Panel</a>)
Stress Test evaluate how well the heart functions with activity, diagnose CAD and arrhythmias, evaluate treatment, and determine the risk of having an MI
Exercise Stress Test - exercises on a treadmill or bicycle, with increasing intensity. HR, BP, and EKG are monitored during the test.
stop stress test once chest pain is present
Stress Test Echocardiogram - same as exercise but with echo (U/S)
Nuclear Stress Test - radioactive dye is used during stress test
Initial management: MONA (morphine, aspirin, nitro, O2)STEMI
Cardiac Catherization / Coronary Angiogram - diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure; insertion of catheter into a blood vessel
visualize the coronary arteries using contrast dye and X-ray imaging to identify blockages, narrowing, or other abnormalities
used to plan angioplasty, stent placement, or other revascularization procedures.
PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) - non-surgical procedure to treat coronary artery blockages and restore blood flow to the heart
aka Angioplasty within 90 minutes, if not: fibrinolysis within 120 minutes
catheter through the skin (usually via the groin or wrist) and threading it to the coronary arteries to open up blockages
balloon angioplasty, stent placement, atherectomy
CABG - coronary artery bypass graft
dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel)
not first line therapy, must be given 6-9 hoursNSTEMI / UA
more conservative treatment, depends on severity
DAPT/anticoags, betablockers
heparin does not dissolve clots, only prevents it
post catherization: absent pedal pulses may be present 4-12 hourschest pain = EKG, lab draw
ST is LOW = O2 is low
ST is HIGH = muscles have diedelevated troponin = 150-300 mg aspirin, IV heparin
antiplatelet therapy with either ticagrelor or clopidogrel taken by mouth <br><a href=".?query=tag:nursing" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#nursing">#nursing</a> <a href=".?query=tag:medsurg" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#medsurg">#medsurg</a> <a href=".?query=tag:cardiovascular" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#cardiovascular">#cardiovascular</a> <a href=".?query=tag:mi" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#mi">#mi</a>]]></description><link>med-surg/cardiovascular/cad-&amp;-mi.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Med-Surg/Cardiovascular/CAD &amp; MI.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:35:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EKG - Critical Care]]></title><description><![CDATA[Note only shockable rhythms: VFib, pulseless VTsee <a data-href="EKG" href="med-surg/cardiovascular/ekg.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">EKG</a> for basics
Overview: A rapid, abnormal heart rhythm originating in the ventricles, often life-threatening and requiring immediate intervention.
Rate: 100-250 bpm
Rhythm: Regular
P-Waves: Not typically visible or unrelated to QRS complex
QRS Complex: Wide (greater than 0.12 seconds), bizarre shape
PR Interval: Not measurable or absent
Stable VTACH Treatment: minimal symptoms: administer amiodarone or lidocaine (antiarrhythmic drugs), consider cardioversion if drug therapy is ineffective. unstable VTACH: immediate synchronized cardioversion or defibrillation if no pulse is present. Consider an ICD (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator) for recurrent episodes.
Symptoms: palpitations, syncope, chest pain, shortness of breath, cardiac arrest, or even sudden cardiac death.
Synchronized Cardioversion
typically less than what is required for defib
set to synchronize =&gt; track R waves
typically 50-100 joules, max 200
Remember: pulseless VT =&gt; defib, CPR, intubate, epi, ami/lidonote: VTACH is from ventricles, SVT is from atrium
note: VTACH has wide QRS, SVT has narrow QRSCardioversion - performed on clients who have a pulse but are not stable hemodynamically; a low energy, synchronous shock that is delivered at the exact point of the QRS complex - R to be exactNote: follow CAB priority framework during CPRCauses: underlying ischemic heart disease, acute MI, dilated cardiomyppathy, e-, structural heart disaese, illicit drug use (meth, coke)<br><img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/set-ecg-common-abnormalities-ventricular-260nw-2267147927.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">

Rhythm: Can be regular or irregular depending on underlying electrical activity
P-Waves: Present or absent, depending on the underlying rhythm
QRS Complex: Present or absent, depending on the underlying rhythm
PR Interval: Present or absent, depending on the underlying rhythm
Treatment: Immediate CPR, administer epinephrine, and correct the underlying cause (e.g., hypoxia, electrolyte imbalances, trauma). Follow ACLS protocols for resuscitation.

Longer, longer, longer, drop! Then you have a WENCKEBACH
Overview: A progressive delay in AV node conduction until a QRS complex is dropped; often transient and may not require treatment.
Rate: Usually normal or slightly slow
Rhythm: Irregular due to dropped beats
P-Waves: Present, with more P-waves than QRS complexes
QRS Complex: Normal (0.06-0.10 seconds)
PR Interval: Progressively lengthens until a QRS complex is dropped
Treatment: Typically no intervention if asymptomatic. If symptomatic (e.g., dizziness, syncope), consider atropine (for brady) or temporary pacing. Monitor closely for progression to a higher-degree block.
Causes: medications sch as CCBs, beta-blockers, digitalis, amiodarone, adenosine, increase in vagal tone, post cardiac surgery, e- imbalance, cardiomyopathies, hyperkalemia, MI, myocarditisPresentation: no physical manifestations, and minimal hemodynamic alterationsIf some P’s don’t get through, then you have MOBITZ II
Overview: A more serious block where some P-waves are not conducted to the ventricles without a progressive PR interval change; higher risk of progressing to third-degree block.
Location: bundle of His, bundle branches, or fascicles (basically the ventricles)
Rate: Usually slow, depending on the number of dropped beats
Rhythm: Regular or irregular (based on conduction pattern)
P-Waves: Present, with more P-waves than QRS complexes
QRS Complex: Often widened (&gt;0.12 seconds) if block occurs below the AV node
PR Interval: Constant in conducted beats (no progressive lengthening)
Treatment: Permanent pacemaker placement is often indicated due to risk of progression to complete heart block. Temporary pacing is done while waiting. Other info:
Causes: MI, necrosis in heart, e-, CCBs, betablockers, amiodarone, digoxin, adenosine, post cardiac surgery
Patho: block in conduction system (usually bundle of HIS or bundle branches)
Presentation: bradycardia, fatigue, syncope, dyspnea, dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, and nausea
Things to note
if caused by meds, stop those meds
there is increased risk for falls d/t fatigue, dizziness, SOB
If P’s and Q’s don’t agree, then you have a THIRD DEGREE
Overview: A complete heartblock! Total disruption of electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles, causing them to beat independently; a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.
Rate: Atrial rate typically normal, ventricular rate slow (usually &lt; 40 bpm)
Rhythm: Regular, but atrial and ventricular rhythms are independent
P-Waves: Present, unrelated to QRS complexes (no consistent PR interval)
QRS Complex: May be narrow or wide depending on the location of the block
PR Interval: Variable with no consistent relationship between P-waves and QRS complexes
Treatment: Immediate intervention required; temporary transcutaneous pacing followed by permanent pacemaker placement is the primary treatment. Administer atropine or epinephrine if symptomatic while awaiting pacing
manifestations: varies: bradycardia, chest pain, shortness of breath, generalized fatigue, or syncope, altered LOC, JVDbradycardic manifestations: decompensated heart failure, decreased capillary refill, cool skin, diaphoresis, altered mental status, tachypnea, cool skin, retraction, and respiratory distress Things to note:
increased risk for falls
increased risk for nausea and aspiration
Atropine is for bradycardia since 3rd Degree blocks feature a ventricular escape rhythm (which is slower)
Amiodarone is for tachyarrhythmias (AFIB, VT, VF) post-op: avoid strenuous activity, keep arm immobilized
do not drive for 2-3 weeks
use arm sling during night time (and during day if possible)
do not move arm above shoulder level
wear medical alert bracelet
beware of magnets, large motors, radars, MRIs
no contact sports
keep cellphones at least 6 inches
regular monitoring of function, battery life, identified abnormal rhythms

classified based on timing
Hyperacute
within 48 hours after surgery
small blood clots to form in the transplanted kidney irreversible
fever, hypertension, pain
treatment: removal of kidney
Acute
1 week to 2 years after surgery
body destroys the donor kidney =&gt; vasculitis, cellular destruction starts with inflammation
Oliguria, anuria, low-grade fever, hypertension, tenderness over the transplanted kidney, lethargy, azotemia, and fluid retention
Treatment: Involves increased doses of immunosuppressive medications
Chronic
gradually over months to years
Blood vessel injury from overgrowth of the smooth muscles of the blood vessels causing fibrotic tissue to replace normal tissue, resulting in a nonfunctioning donor kidney
gradual return of azotemia, fluid retention, electrolyte imbalance, and fatigue
Treatment: Conservative (monitor kidney status, continue immunosuppressive therapy) until dialysis is required Renal artery stenosis is due to scarring of surgical anastomosis.
findings: hypertension, bruit, decreased kidney function: oliguria, elevated BUN &amp; Cr
task: kidney scan to verify renal blood flow

CNS =&gt; brain &amp; spinal cord
Meninges - continuous connective tissue layers covering the spine and brain
Layers of meninges: pia mater, arachnoid, dura
CSF = located in subarachnoid space
Spinal Cord roles:
send stimuli from body to brain
send motor instructions from brain to body
direct reflexes
Spinal Cord Reflexes - do not rely on brain to transmit reflexVertebrae Count- In Order: Breakfast at 7, Lunch at 12, Dinner at 5
Cervical - 7 (but has 8 cervical nerve roots)
Thoracic - 12
Lumbar - 5
Sacral - 5
Coccyx - 1
Classification based on Mechanism of Injury:
Compression of Spinal Cord - most common, caused by vertebral fractures with bone fragments or dislocation
Intermittent Compression - often seen in hyperextension injuries
Distraction Injury - two adjoining vertebrae have been pulled apart, causing the spine to stretch and tear. Transection and Laceration - a projectile object or bone fragments from significant dislocations can tear or sever the spinal cord. Classification based on Location =&gt; see vertebrae countClassification based on Severity =&gt; loss of all sensation and control below the damage (complete, vs incomplete)
A - complete SCI, no sensory function, no motor function
B - some sensory function, no motor function
C - some sensory function, some motor function (less than half can lift against gravity)
D - same as C, but more than half have motor
Secondary Injury - result after the initial injury d/t impaired blood flow (e.g. inflammation, hematoma formation, blood loss, and hypovolemic shock)
Impaired Mobility
Sexual Dysfunction - depends on level of injury
Mental health: dealing with changes and limitations, body image, suicide risk
Aging =&gt; patients with SCIs age faster =&gt; more likely to have bone loss, chronic pain, kidney stones, and pressure injuries prevention: motor vehicle safety, seat belts, airbags, car seats, no texting, no DUIs
Falls risk for elderly
responsible gun ownership
sports protective gear
water safety
Trampolines are well lit and ground level to prevent falls, avoid crowing, netting in place, supervise
**Tetraplegia
injuries from C1 to T1
unable to move all extremities (can be all the way from head, neck, to legs)
Paraplegia
loss of fnuction of lower portion of body from chest to lower extremities
T2 to S5
5 Plexuses:
C1 to C4: ventilator dependence
C1 to C8: limited proprioception
T1 to T8: affects trunk movement, lack of abdominal control
T9 to T12: limited abdominal control
L1 to S5: loss of bowel and bladder functioning, affects sexual function

Neurological disorders: Brain trauma, infections, and strokes increase risk.
Certain medications: Drugs that enhance ADH secretion or action. Neurological symptoms: Headache, confusion, irritability, seizures, coma (due to hyponatremia).
Gastrointestinal symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia.
Fluid retention: Weight gain, without edema (since fluid is retained intracellularly).
Cardiovascular effects: Hypertension, bounding pulses, jugular vein distension.
Urinary changes: Decreased UOP, concentrated urine with high specific gravity. Severe hyponatremia (&lt;120 mEq/L): Can lead to seizures, coma, and death.
Cerebral edema: Due to water shifting into brain cells, leading to increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
Pulmonary edema: Fluid overload can impair respiratory function. ADH elevated (normal 1-5 ng/L)
Low serum sodium (&lt;135 mEq/L).
Low serum osmolality (&lt;280 mOsm/kg) =&gt; normal is 275-290 mOsm/kg

High urine specific gravity (&gt;1.030). =&gt; normal range is between 1.005 and 1.030. ADH levels: Increased despite normal or expanded intravascular volume. Fluid restriction: First-line treatment (500–1000 mL/day) to prevent further dilutional hyponatremia.
Hypertonic saline (3%): For severe hyponatremia, given cautiously to prevent rapid sodium shifts.
Diuretics (loop diuretics like furosemide): To promote free water excretion if sodium is &gt;125 mEq/L.
Demeclocycline: A tetracycline that blocks ADH action in kidneys.
Vasopressin receptor antagonists (Tolvaptan, Conivaptan): Block ADH effect in severe cases. Monitor sodium levels closely to prevent complications of rapid correction (e.g., central pontine myelinolysis).
Assess for neurological changes: Confusion, restlessness, seizures, and coma.
Strict fluid intake and output (I&amp;O) monitoring to prevent fluid overload.
Daily weights to detect fluid retention.
Implement seizure precautions for patients with severe hyponatremia.
Educate patients on fluid restrictions and symptoms of worsening SIADH. Excess fluid volume related to water retention.

Coma and death CT scan/MRI (detect swelling, bleeding, tumors, hydrocephalus)
ICP monitoring (ventriculostomy, intraparenchymal device)
Lumbar puncture contraindicated =&gt; increases ICP (d/t decreasing pressure gradient in spine further pushes brain downward)
Fundoscopic exam (papilledema)
Ventriculostomy - insertion of a catheter into one of the brain's ventricles to drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or to monitor intracranial pressure.
Ventriculostomy Transducer =&gt; maintain at the level of the tragus
Reduce ICP and prevent complications
Elevate HOB 30 degrees (promotes venous drainage)
Oxygen therapy (maintain cerebral oxygenation)
Mechanical ventilation (if necessary) – PaCO₂ 30-35 mmHg to reduce cerebral blood flow
Surgery: craniotomy, external ventricular drain (EVD) to drain excess CSF, decompressive craniectomy (remove park of skull)
Decrease metabolic demand: barbiturates, sedation, pain control
Medications:
Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) – reduces cerebral edema =&gt; initial target of serum osmolality is often set at 300–320 mOsmol/kg. Hypertonic saline (3%) – pulls fluid out of brain cells
Corticosteroids (dexamethasone) – for tumors, inflammation
Sedatives (propofol, benzodiazepines) – decrease metabolic demand
Antiepileptics – prevent seizures: benzo, phenytoin, valproic acid
Neuromuscular blockers (for severe cases requiring intubation) No Lumbar Punctures allowed! =&gt; increases ICP (d/t decreasing pressure gradient in spine further pushes brain downward)
Monitor LOC and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (↓ GCS = worsening ICP)
maintaining the ventriculostomy transducer at the level of the tragus
Assess pupil reaction (PERRLA) and vital signs frequently
Maintain head and neck alignment (avoid flexion or turning head)
Minimize stimulation (low lights, quiet room)
Avoid straining (stool softeners, prevent coughing/sneezing)
Cluster nursing care to minimize ICP spikes
Seizure precautions (padded rails, oxygen, suction at bedside)
Monitor for signs of herniation (fixed dilated pupils, loss of reflexes, coma)

Primary Triage - in the field
Secondary - at ED, triage nurse assigns 3 or 5 tier categories
Tertiary - when the client exits the ED and is moved into the ICU or operating room Emergent - life-threatening illness or injury
Urgent - treatment can be delayed, not immediately life-threatening
Delayed - minor injuries or illnesses, higher priority patients are dealt with first
Patient assessment
Primary Survey- ABCDE
Secondary Survey - Head to Toe assessment
Tertiary Survey - final step to uncover injuries that have been missed =&gt; anytime and before hospital discharge External Regulations in Nursing: state laws
Internal Regulations in Nursing: organization policy &amp; procedures
critical care nurses are except from state nurse practice acts when they work in Federal entities: VA, DOD, Indian Health Service
EMTALA
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) - law that prevents refusing care to uninsured patients
EMTALA: patients need to be stabilized first before transferring to another facility
EMTALA - exception during during disasters, patients can be transferred without being stabilized first
all documentation should be transferred with the patient
SEXUAL ASSAULT
fear of being stigmatized =&gt; #1 reason why victims do not report
Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) should be assigned to the client who has experienced sexual assault: provide support, forensic exams, collect evidence "rape kit"
sexual assault victims - collect evidence, test HIV with PEP, emergency contraception
Certified Forensic photographer must take photos
Consent must be obtained prior to exam
Collect evidence ASAP
HIV prophylaxis must be given within 72 hours
provide contraception ASAP Breaking bad news: provide information in bit and pieces to allow for digestion of information
Media relations: do no talk with them, follow protocols
Social media: avoid sharing information, follow HIPAA
nurse should also be aware of the location of the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all chemicals used in the facility. hazard vulnerability analysis, Emergency Operations Plan - required by joint commission
PPE Shortage - reuse them by cleaning, do not conserve: PPE usage is still required
Phases:
Planning - risk assessment, identifying hazards, creating disaster plan
Response = activation of plan, command post, lines of communication, nurse provides triage and care
Recovery - continued care, monitor, transport, watch mental health of team and patients, evaluate Green Tag - minor injuries, obeys commands: lacerations, sprains
Yellow - delayed: fractures, open wounds, deep lacerations
Red - immediate, may survive if treated, neuro injury, shock, major burns, CPR is applied, hemcon
Black - deceased or not expected to live provide power to government officials to activate authorities and resources bystander CPR programs - offered by AHA
Stop the Bleed program - teach bystanders to stop blood loss

remove excess fluid + electrolytes
acid-base balance
remove waste products
restore homeostasis thru osmosis, diffusion, ultra-filtration
Types of Dialysis:
Hemodialysis: Blood is filtered through a machine outside the body to remove waste and excess fluids.
Peritoneal Dialysis: Uses the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) to filter blood inside the body by infusing a dialysis solution into the abdomen.Dialysis Access Sites
Hemodialysis: Fistulas, grafts, or central venous catheters (CVC)
Peritoneal Dialysis: Catheter inserted into the abdominal cavityDialysis Procedure
Hemodialysis: Blood is removed, cleaned, and returned to the body via a machine over a 3-5 hour period, typically 3 times a week.
Peritoneal Dialysis: Dialysate fluid is infused into the abdomen, where it absorbs waste and excess fluid, and is then drained out, typically performed daily.Considerations for Fistula
assess patency: presence of bruit, palpable thrill, distal pulses, circulation
Avoid the fistula sight! do not: measure BP, inject, venipuncture. Elevate site after fistula creation
Have protamine sulfate ready to reverse heparin.

dry inside - diabetes insipidus
same amount of kool aid powder but with too little water = the juice is too concentrated &amp; has too much flavor (hypernatremia, high serum osmolality)
low release of antidiuretic hormone (aka vasopressin) =&gt; patient keeps peeing nonstop!
key e-: Na
2 Types:
Central DI - neuro, trauma, less common
Nephrogenic DI - kidneys develop resistance to ADH, more common
Less common: gestational DI
Central DI =&gt; brain issue: tumor, bran surgery, infection in CNS =&gt; hypothalamus or pituitary gland
Nephrogenic =&gt; caused by gene mutations, renal diseases, pregnancy, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, meds (lithium, abx, antifungals, antineoplastics)
congenital - rare (affects hypothalamus)
autoimmune or vascular diseases
sarcoidosis
ischemia any condition related to injury of hypothalamus or pituitary: neurosurgery, infection, genetic disorder
damage to kidneys (lithium, amphotericin B, demeclocycline) =&gt; stop meds right away
gestational DI =&gt; pregnancy
MS - dipsogenic DI (excessive thirst) thirst does not go away =&gt; polydipsia
polyuria - excessive urinating
nocturia
HIGH SODIUM &gt; leads to excessive thirst; hypernatremia patients who have no thirst perception have greater risk
increased risk for skin impairment due to nocturia nocturia - urination at night, less sleep
higher risk for mortality d/t fever, dehydration, hypernatremia, cv complication Serum ADH less than 1, =&gt; nephrogenic, more than 5= central (normal is 1 to 5 ng/L)
diluted urine - urine osmolality is low (normal average is 500-900; anything under 300 is DI)
Urine Specific Gravity confirms DI: Less than 1.005 (normal range is 1.005-1.03)
Urine sodium 24 hours - less than 40 mg/day
look for UOP of greater than 3L/day
water deprivation test differentiates between central and nephrogenic
stimulates secretion of ADH
DI: urine osmolality does not increase over 300 mosm/kg Nurse task: ensure water is withheld
body weight and urine osmolality are measured HOURLY
Other Lab Tests considered:
Serum sodium, osmolality
urine BUN Central DI: desmopressin - an analog of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and the hormone replacement of choice for diabetes insipidus; REABSORBS WATER IN KIDNEYS
most effective route for desmopressin: intranasal 5-10 mcg at bedtime
other drugs to increase ADH: carbamazepine, chlorpropamide
Thiazide Diuretics: usually with nephrogenic (sometimes in central DI); thiazides induce mild hypovolemia which results in less urine output eventually, thus retain more water
renal diet
Dextrose or any hypOtonic fluids =&gt; 500-750mL/hr infusion rate (NOTE: DO NOT INFUSE HYPERTONIC!)
Adverse reactions of desmopressin: hyponatremia, palpitations, tachycardia, headache, rhinitis, nasal congestion, pruritus, edema of the eyes
indwelling catheter is usually indicated =&gt; strict I/O

COPD is a broad term that includes bronchitis and emphysema
Emphysema
permanent enlargement of airspaces and destruction of airspace walls

Chronic Bronchitis - inflammation of bronchial tubes, leading to increased mucus production and coughing
common: cigarette smoke =&gt; more mucus production =&gt; cilliary function decreases =&gt; inflammation
thickened and fibrosed alveoli =&gt; damaged macrophages =&gt; more infection smoking
exposure to noxious gases
occupational exposure to dust, fumes
environmental pollutants, biomass fuel

a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
Types:
Traumatic Pneumothorax
blunt or penetrating trauma creates one-way valve into pleural space
air goes in but does not go out
common causes: rib fracture, bult trauma, flying or diving, changes in pressure
subtypes:
Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) - without underlying lung disease but in the presence of asymptomatic bullae or blebs that rupture
Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (SSP) - lung disease is present, most commonly, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Open Pneumo - air entering through an open wound in the chest (sucking sound occurs as air rushes through the chest walls)
Iatrogenic - type of traumatic; caused by a medical treatment or procedure (thoracentesis or biopsy)
Tension Pneumo - severe form, air enters the chest cavity, becomes trapped, and cannot be expelled (common causes: barotrauma, ventilation tracheostomy injury, occlusive dressing ineffective)
subpleural bleb - a small air-filled cyst located on the surface of the lung, close to the pleural lining. They are typically asymptomatic but can rupture, leading to a pneumothorax
smoking cigarettes or MJ
tall &amp; thin
pregnancy
Marfan Syndrome - genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissues

A life-threatening condition where a thrombus or emboli blocks blood flow in the pulmonary arteries, reducing oxygen exchange and straining the heart.
Medical Emergency!
Terms to note:
Thrombus - A blood clot that forms within a blood vessel
Embolus - moving clot or particle that travels through the bloodstream until it lodges in a smaller vessel; made up of fat, air, or tumorHence, a thrombus can become an emboliREMEMBER:
Thrombus = Stays Put
Embolus = Moves and Block DVT (most common cause)
Fat embolism (from fractures)
Air embolism (from IV lines or trauma)
Amniotic fluid embolism (during labor)
Tumor embolism (from metastatic cancer)
Virchow’s triad - increased coagulability, venous stasis, and endothelial tissue injuryVenous Thromboembolism (VTE) - when patient presents with both PE and DVTRisk Factors:
females (early and middle adult age groups)
males (elderly)
age: 40+
Black Americans
Family History/Genetics: thrombophilia, protein C or S deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia
Venous Statis: Immobility or prolonged bed rest travel greater than 4 hr by air
bedrest greater than three days Surgery (especially orthopedic or abdominal)
Hospitalization for HF, A.Fib, A.Flutter, central venous catherization
Obesity
Pregnancy and postpartum period
Smoking
Oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (ESTROGEN BASED)
Cancer - tumors may dislodge, more immobile
Previous DVT or PE
Fractures (especially long bones)
Poor - increased air pollution exposure sudden onset dyspnea - most common
chest pain
tachypnea
tachycardia
hypoxia
anxiety &amp; restlessness
cough
HEMOPTYSIS - not a common presenting manifestation (ATI) blood or blood-tinged sputum from the mouth or trachea that originated in the lungs or the lower respiratory tract. Severe: syncope, hypotension, cyanosis, shock symptoms
Less common: arrythmias (AFIB), JVD
Low Risk - asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable
Intermediate-Risk (or submassive) - right ventricular dysfunction, low BP (corrected with IVF)
High-Risk - hemodynamically unstable
Pulmonary hypertension
Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale)
Shock
Death (if untreated) CTPA - computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram =&gt; Gold Standard, uses contrast dye thru arteries, then x-ray. visualizes arteries, locates obstruction
ABG =&gt; reveals respiratory alkalosis, hypocapnia
Troponin =&gt; may be elevated in moderate to large PEs
D-Dimer - elevated d/t presence of clot
Chest X-Ray =&gt; may not show PE but can rule out atelectasis, effusion, or other causes for dyspnea
Assessment Findings:
abnormal lung sounds on auscultation: rales or diminished
abnormal heart sounds: gallop
Treatment Goals:
Maintain Oxygenation, at least 90% SPO2
Maintain Mental Status
Prevent Further Emoblism
Avoid Complications
Interventions
Supplemental O2
Mechanical Ventilation if unstable
ECMO - extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
Thrombolysis (Alteplase) - clot-busting meds Thrombectomy - surgical removal of clot using endovascular device
Anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, enoxaparin) - does not dissolve clots but prevents new ones from forming
Anticoagulation therapy for a minimum of three months Evaluate Risk Factors for a VTE: examine lower extremities; note swelling, warmth, tender or hard veins in calves
Prevention is Easier Than Treatment! - ensure VTE prophylaxis (pharmacological or mechanical-SCDs), encourage ambulation, hydration
Note bleeding risk R/T anticoagulant therapy
Educate: anticoagulation medications, increased chance of recurrence, medical tag/bracelet, bleeding precautions, avoid risky activities, mobility, lifestyle, nutrition

A condition where food moves too quickly from the stomach into the small intestine, causing fluid shifts and hormonal responses. Common after gastric surgery (e.g., gastrectomy, gastric bypass). Gastric surgery (partial or total gastrectomy, gastric bypass, vagotomy). Rapid gastric emptying due to loss of normal pyloric control. High-sugar meals, which pull fluid into the intestine, worsening symptoms. =&gt; AVOID HIGH CARB History of gastric surgery. High-carbohydrate diet. Small stomach size or altered digestion due to surgery. Early Dumping Syndrome (Within 30 Minutes of Eating)
Abdominal cramping, bloating, nausea. Diarrhea (due to rapid fluid shift into intestines). Tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness (from fluid loss and vasodilation). Diaphoresis (sweating).
Late Dumping Syndrome (1-3 Hours After Eating)
Rebound hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin release. Weakness, dizziness, confusion. Sweating, shakiness, palpitations. Severe dehydration from diarrhea. Malnutrition and weight loss due to food avoidance. Hypoglycemia from late-phase insulin surge. Glucose tolerance test – Identifies late dumping syndrome. Gastric emptying study – Confirms rapid emptying. Clinical history and symptom pattern. Dietary modifications: Eat small, frequent meals. Avoid high-carb foods (especially simple sugars). Increase protein and healthy fats to slow digestion. Drink fluids between meals, not with meals. Lie down after eating to slow gastric emptying. Medications: Acarbose (delays carbohydrate absorption, prevents hypoglycemia). Octreotide (reduces gastric motility). Surgical options (rarely needed): Reconstructive surgery to slow gastric emptying. Monitor for dehydration (tachycardia, hypotension). Educate on dietary changes to prevent symptoms. Assess blood sugar levels for hypoglycemia. Encourage rest after meals to reduce rapid dumping. ]]></description><link>med-surg/gi/dumping-syndrome.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Med-Surg/GI/Dumping Syndrome.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 01:11:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cancer Treatment]]></title><description><![CDATA[
is a type of radiation therapy during which the radiation source is in direct contact with the client's tumor. DIFFERENT FROM CHEMO - chemo is directed throughout the whole body
MORE precise therapy - directly into cancer cells
During the therapy, the client emits radiation and is potentially hazardous to others. The client should be in a private room with a private bathroom, and the nurse should keep the door to the client's room closed.
PER ATI:
2-5 treatment, one or twice a week
no restriction on proximity - no excreted radiation between treatments (you can stand close to them)
there should be no blood - report immediately if there is!
patient will stay still Systemic treatment using cytotoxic drugs to destroy or inhibit cancer cell growth
Administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intrathecally
Contraindications:
Severe immunosuppression Active infection Organ dysfunction (e.g., liver or kidney failure) Pregnancy (specific agents may be contraindicated)
Nursing Tasks
Administer chemotherapy safely following protocols and PPE guidelines Monitor for immediate reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, infusion site issues) Assess for side effects such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, or myelosuppression Provide patient education on side effect management and treatment schedule Ensure proper handling, disposal, and spill management of cytotoxic agents
Nursing Considerations
Monitor CBC, renal, and liver function before and during treatment Assess for signs of infection, bleeding, or anemia Implement supportive care measures (e.g., antiemetics, hydration, pain control) Educate on neutropenic precautions and infection prevention AVOID DIRECT SUNLIGHT! - skin on radiation path is sensitive to sun damage
Provide emotional support and address psychosocial concerns
Chemotherapy Combination Meds - Different chemotherapeutic agents act at various stages of cellular mitosis (division). By combining agents, medication therapy is more effective in stopping or slowing the growth of cancerous cells by interfering with their ability to multiply.
Do NOT remove the markings - they are guides for treatment - important for accuracy!
use hands instead of wash cloth in doing skin care - skin is sensitive during therapy
avoid direct sunlight for at least 6 months
skin is more sensitive to burns

Underactive thyroid gland causing low thyroid hormone levels
Leads to slowed metabolism and systemic effects
Common in middle-aged/older adults, more in females
HypO = HashimotO = lOw n slOw T3/T4 is LOW = HypO
T3/T4 causes increased expression of B-adrenergic receptors (causing increased FIGHT OR FLIGHT response =&gt; opposite for hyPO) Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (autoimmune destruction) - immune system mistakenly attacks your thyroid, slowly killing it off and making you feel tired, cold, and sluggish
Iodine deficiency or excess
Thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy
Pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction (↓ TSH or TRH)
Medications (lithium, amiodarone)

<br><a data-href="Antiplatelets" href="pharmacology/cardiovascular/antiplatelets.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Antiplatelets</a> - inhibit activation of platelets
Anticoags from NurseintheMaking
Anticoagulants prevent new clots from forming, prevent current clots from getting bigger; not blood thinners!
Uses: DVT, PE, A-Fib, post-op patients
Heparin (LMWH - Low Molecular Weight Heparin: Lovenox - generic enoxaparin) IV or SQ
Rapid onset, Heparins Happens Fast - great for short term therapy
Monitor: aPTT (heparin has “P” in it) - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time - how fast blood clots
“If numbers are high, the patient will die”, if low - clots will grow - must be therapeutic range
Antidote: Protamine Sulfate Educate: subq 2” from umbilicus, 90deg, do not massage site, bruising/pain is common Warfarin (Coumadin) Commonly PO
Slow - hours-day / “Warfarin you have to Wait”
Can be given with Heparin together
Monitor: INR - International Normalized Ratio - how fast blood clots
“If numbers are high, the patient will die”, if low - clots will grow - must be therapeutic range
Antidote: Vitamin K (during War, Vitamin K KILLS Warfarin!) Educate: Be consistent with Vit K intake - green leafy, liver Know the Difference!
Anticoagulants - interfere with the body's clotting factors (proteins) in the coagulation cascade to prevent clot formation
Uses: prevention of venous thromboembolisms (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke, afib
Antiplatelets - inhibit platelet aggregation (clumping) to prevent the formation of clots in arteries
Uses: prevent heart attacks strokes, and other cardiovascular events related to atherosclerosisHemostasis - delicate balance regulated by substances in blood: procoagulants vs anticoagulants
Thromboembolic Disorder - too much clotting (leads to thrombi or emboli)
Coagulation Disorder - too little clotting, leads to excessive bleeding Thrombocytopenia - decreased platelet production or super platelet destruction Labs to diagnose bleeding disorder:
prothrombin time (PT)
thrombin time
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
in some instances, a bleeding time.Prefilled Subcutaneous Injection - Enoxaparin
do not expel air bubbles - they make sure that full dose is given
inject med into anterolateral abdominal wall
DO NOT MASSAGE site after injection =&gt; can cause bruising &amp; tissue damage with anticoagulants

Chronic autoimmune disease causing systemic inflammation and progressive joint destruction
Patho: synovium is inflamed, immune system attacks tissue surrounding joint, causing damage (including eyes, mouth, heart, lungs)
Symmetrical polyarthritis, primarily affecting small joints (hands, wrists, feet)
Leads to pain, swelling, stiffness, and deformities
Can also affect organs (heart, lungs, eyes, skin) Autoimmune response triggering synovial inflammation
Genetic predisposition (HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1 genes)
Environmental triggers (e.g., smoking, infections) Female sex (3:1 female-to-male ratio)
Ages 30-50 (peak onset)
Family history of RA
Smoking (strongest modifiable risk factor)
Obesity (linked to disease severity)
Infections (may trigger immune response) Symmetric joint pain and stiffness (lasting &gt;1 hour in the morning)
Swollen, warm, and tender joints
Most commonly affects: fingers, wrists, elbows, knees, ankles
Joint deformities over time (swan neck, boutonnière, ulnar deviation)
Fatigue, low-grade fever, weight loss
AFFECTS THE WHOLE BODY
Mouth - gum disease, dry, tooth decay
Limbs - deformities, swelling, locking, weakening, ruptured tendons, bunions
Skin: rash, ulcers, Rheumatoid nodules (subcutaneous lumps), neuropathy
Lungs: <a data-href="COPD" href="med-surg/respiratory/copd.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">COPD</a>, (interstitial fibrosis, pleuritis)

Assess neurovascular status regularly: check circulation, movement, sensation (CMS), color, temperature, pulses, cap refill. Elevate the casted limb above heart level for the first 24–48 hours to reduce swelling. Turn the patient every 2 hours if in a body cast to prevent skin breakdown. Keep the cast dry if it’s not waterproof — cover with plastic when bathing. Use the palm of your hands (not fingers) to handle a wet plaster cast to prevent indentations. Report signs of complications: numbness, tingling, severe pain, swelling, foul odor, drainage, or cool/pale skin. Encourage movement of fingers/toes distal to the cast to maintain circulation. Apply ice packs to the cast over a towel for the first 24–48 hrs to reduce swelling (if approved). Don’t insert objects (like pens or coat hangers) into the cast to relieve itching — risk of injury and infection. Don't insert cotton wipe to dry inside cast - use blow dryer on COOL setting instead
Don’t get the cast wet, unless it's made of water-resistant material. Don’t cover a wet cast with plastic — it traps heat and moisture and may cause skin damage. Don’t ignore foul smells or drainage — these could be signs of infection or pressure ulcers under the cast. Don’t bear weight on the cast unless it’s a walking cast and the doctor says it’s okay. Don’t trim or pull apart edges of the cast — always consult a provider if the cast is uncomfortable or damaged. ]]></description><link>med-surg/x-other-systems/musculoskeletal/cast-care.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Med-Surg/X - Other Systems/Musculoskeletal/Cast Care.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 18:22:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Colostomy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Chronic autoimmune connective tissue disorder causing hardening and tightening of the skin and internal organs
the body produces and deposits too much collagen, causing thickening and hardening
Divided into two types: Localized Scleroderma – Limited to skin and underlying tissues. Systemic Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis) – Involves skin, blood vessels, and internal organs. Exact cause unknown; involves immune system dysfunction, genetic factors, and environmental triggers. Female sex (most common in women aged 30-50). Family history of autoimmune diseases. Exposure to silica dust, solvents, or industrial chemicals. Viral infections may play a role. Skin thickening and hardening (fingers, face, and extremities).
contractures - tissues around joints become stiff and tight, limiting the range of motion and potentially causing the joint to become fixed in a bent position (fingers - most common, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, ankles) - all extremities basically

Tight, shiny skin over affected areas. Joint pain and stiffness. Esophageal dysmotility (difficulty swallowing, acid reflux). Telangiectasia (visible blood vessels on the skin). Organ involvement may lead to lung fibrosis, heart issues, or kidney dysfunction. Pulmonary hypertension. Heart failure from myocardial fibrosis. Scleroderma renal crisis (acute kidney failure and severe hypertension). Digital ulcers and gangrene from poor circulation. Malnutrition from GI involvement. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test – Often positive. Anti-Scl-70 antibody – Specific for systemic scleroderma. Anti-centromere antibody – Common in limited scleroderma. Skin biopsy confirms fibrosis. Imaging (e.g., CT scan, echocardiogram) assesses organ damage. Immunosuppressants (e.g., methotrexate, cyclophosphamide). Calcium channel blockers for Raynaud’s. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for acid reflux. ACE inhibitors for renal crisis prevention. Vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension. Promote skin care with moisturizers to reduce dryness and irritation. Encourage warm clothing and lifestyle adjustments to manage Raynaud’s. Monitor for hypertension, renal function, and respiratory changes. Provide small, frequent meals to reduce GI discomfort. Educate about the chronic nature of the disease and coping strategies. Impaired Skin Integrity related to fibrosis and tight skin. Ineffective Airway Clearance related to pulmonary fibrosis. Chronic Pain related to joint stiffness and inflammation. Risk for Impaired Tissue Perfusion related to vascular involvement.

A vasospastic disorder that causes intermittent constriction of small arteries, usually in fingers and toes. Triggered by cold exposure or stress, leading to reduced blood flow and color changes. Primary Raynaud’s: Idiopathic with no underlying disease. Secondary Raynaud’s: Associated with autoimmune conditions (e.g., <a data-href="Scleroderma" href="med-surg/immunity-&amp;-inflammation/scleroderma.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Scleroderma</a>, <a data-href="Lupus" href="med-surg/immunity-&amp;-inflammation/lupus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lupus</a>, <a data-href="Rheumatoid Arthritis" href="med-surg/immunity-&amp;-inflammation/rheumatoid-arthritis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rheumatoid Arthritis</a>). Female sex (more common in women ages 15–40). Cold environments. Family history of Raynaud’s or autoimmune disease. Occupational triggers (e.g., vibration tools). Smoking (vasoconstriction). Triphasic color changes in digits: White (pallor) from vasoconstriction. Blue (cyanosis) from poor oxygenation. Red (rubor) from reperfusion. Numbness, tingling, burning pain during or after attacks. Cold, pale, or blue fingers/toes, often symmetrical. Ulcers or sores on fingers in severe cases. Tissue necrosis if blood flow is severely compromised. Functional impairment with frequent attacks. Clinical history and symptoms during cold/stress exposure. Nailfold capillaroscopy to examine capillary structure (esp. in secondary). Antibody testing (ANA, anti-centromere) for autoimmune association. Lifestyle modifications: Avoid cold, wear gloves, keep core warm. Manage stress. Stop smoking. Medications: Calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine) – relax vessels. Vasodilators (e.g., topical nitroglycerin). In secondary cases, treat underlying condition. Severe cases: Sympathectomy (nerve surgery to reduce spasms). Teach cold avoidance strategies and layering clothing. Encourage smoking cessation. Educate on early symptom recognition and attack prevention. Monitor for skin breakdown or signs of ulceration/ischemia. In secondary Raynaud’s, coordinate care for underlying autoimmune disease.

Incision – Clean, straight cut (e.g., surgical wound). Laceration – Irregular, torn wound (e.g., from trauma). Abrasion – Superficial wound caused by friction (e.g., scraped nee). Puncture – Deep, narrow wound caused by a sharp object (e.g., needle stick). Avulsion – Tissue torn away from its normal location (e.g., degloving injury). Ulcer – Open sore due to prolonged pressure or circulation issues (e.g., pressure ulcer). Burn – Tissue damage from heat, chemicals, electricity, or radiation. Primary Intention Edges are approximated (closed) with sutures, staples, or glue. Minimal scarring and healing occurs quickly. Example: Surgical incision. Secondary Intention Wound heals from the inside out; left open to heal naturally. Granulation tissue forms, followed by epithelialization. Higher risk of infection and more scarring. Example: Pressure ulcers, burns, large wounds with tissue loss. Tertiary Intention (Delayed Primary Closure) Wound left open initially, then later closed surgically. Used when there is a high risk of infection or contamination. Example: Infected surgical wound, abdominal wound with dehiscence. ]]></description><link>med-surg/x-other-systems/integumentary/wounds.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Med-Surg/X - Other Systems/Integumentary/Wounds.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:57:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[HIV-AIDS]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) =&gt; a retrovirus that is transmitted through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions)
also found in feces, urine, tears, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, cervical cells, lymph nodes, corneal tissue, and brain tissue
attacks CD4+ T cells, weakening the immune system
CD4
protein found on the surface of certain immune cells, known as helper T cells
crucial in recognizing and responding to infections
CD4 range: 500-1,500 cells/mm3 (average adult, lower for younger or elderly)
Stage 1 - Acute HIV Infection
Occurs 2-4 weeks after exposure
Rapid viral replication and spread
Symptoms: Flu-like symptoms (fever, sore throat, rash, swollen lymph nodes, headache)
Highly infectious phase
CD4+ T-Lymphocyte Count: 500 cells/mm3 or more
Stage 2 - Chronic HIV, latent
Virus continues to replicate at low levels
Can last for several years (longer with ART)
Symptoms: Few or no symptoms
Gradual decline in CD4+ T-cell count
CD4+ T-Lymphocyte Count: 200 to 499 cells/mm3
Stage 3 - AIDS
Final stage, severe immune system damage
Vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers
Symptoms: Severe immunosuppression, opportunistic infections (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonia, candidiasis), cancers (Kaposi’s sarcoma, lymphoma)
CD4+ count below 200 cells/mm³ (less than 14% of lymphocytes) Unprotected seggs (vaginal, anal, oral)
Multiple seggs partners
Occupational exposure (health care workers)
Perinatal exposure
Blood transfusions (not a significant source of infection in the U.S.)
IV drug use with a contaminated needle asymptomatic initially
Chills, fever
Rash
swollen lymph nodes
Anorexia, nausea, weight loss
Weakness and fatigue
Headache and sore throat
Night sweats
Kaposi Sarcoma (cancer) - manifests as hyperpigmented multicentric lesions that can be firm, flat, raised, or nodular. Following a biopsy, the lesions are treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy
Opportunistic infections
cancers (Kaposi’s sarcoma, lymphoma)
neurological issues (HIV-associated dementia)
wasting syndrome - significant unintentional weight loss, muscle wasting, and fatigue
organ failure. CD4+ T-cell count: Normal: 500-1,500 cells/mm³; AIDS diagnosis: &lt;200 cells/mm³
Viral Load: below 40 to 75 copies/mL of blood
<a data-href="CBC" href="foundations/labs/cbc.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CBC</a> and differential: Abnormal (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia)
Platelet count: Decreased less than 150,000/mm3
HIV antibody screening test (ELISA, Western blot, IFA, home test kit)
Test viral load before beginning treatment
HIV Drug resistant testing - guides medication therapy
Brain or lung MRI/CT antiretroviral therapy (ART) - suppress viral replication and restore immune function; lowers viral load
postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) medication - for accidental exposure, must be taken within 72 hours, daily for 28 days All women who are pregnant should be screened for HIV
DO NOT administer live virus vaccines (especially for CD4+ count below 200 cells/mm³ due to the risk of uncontrolled viral replication)
positive Western blot or IFA test =&gt; client has been exposed to and has the AIDS virus in their body BUT does not mean the client has clinical AIDS.
Promote medication adherence
monitor for side effects of ART
educate on transmission prevention
provide emotional support
encourage routine screening
encourage high protein diet - at least six small feedings with high protein value

A long-term intravenous (IV) access device inserted into a peripheral vein (usually the basilic, cephalic, or brachial vein) and advanced to the superior vena cava. Used for long-term medication administration, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and frequent blood draws. Long-term IV therapy (e.g., antibiotics, chemotherapy). Parenteral nutrition when enteral feeding is not possible.
Frequent blood sampling to minimize vein trauma.
Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring in some cases. Local infection or vascular abnormalities at the insertion site. Thrombosis or occlusion in target veins. End-stage renal disease (preferably preserving veins for future dialysis access). Dressing Changes: Use aseptic technique (sterile gloves, chlorhexidine prep). Change transparent dressing every 7 days (or if soiled). Flushing Protocol: Use 10 mL saline before and after use to prevent occlusion. Heparin flush per facility policy (often for non-valved catheters). Blood Draws: Discard 5 mL blood before sampling.
- Flush with 20 mL normal saline post-draw. Assessment: Check for redness, swelling, drainage, or pain at the site. Measure and document external catheter length to detect migration. Patient Education: Avoid heavy lifting with the affected arm. Do not submerge in water (cover during showers). Infection Prevention: Monitor for signs of local (redness, swelling) and systemic infection (fever, chills). Clot Prevention: Flush regularly and assess for sluggish flow or resistance. Catheter Migration: Sudden difficulty flushing or aspiration may indicate dislodgment. Air Embolism Prevention: Clamp the catheter when not in use, and place the patient in Trendelenburg if air embolism is suspected. Regular monitoring and proper care reduce the risk of complications such as infection, thrombosis, or catheter migration.]]></description><link>med-surg/z-misc-topics/lines-drains/peripherally-inserted-central-catheter-(picc).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Med-Surg/Z - Misc Topics/Lines Drains/Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC).md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 20:23:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cholecystitis]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a href=".?query=tag:nursing" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#nursing">#nursing</a> <a href=".?query=tag:medsurg" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#medsurg">#medsurg</a> <a href=".?query=tag:gastrointestinal" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#gastrointestinal">#gastrointestinal</a> <a href=".?query=tag:cholecystitis" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#cholecystitis">#cholecystitis</a>What is it: Inflammation of the gallbladder; can be calculous (gallstone) or acalculous CALCULOUS most common; gallbladder becomes inflamed due to an obstruction caused by a gallstone that may prevent the bile from being expelled ACALCULOUS sudden inflammation of the gallbladder w/o gallstones
more life threatening! high risk of perforation and necrosis that occurs more often in critically ill clients dysfunction of the gallbladder emptying mechanism related to prolonged periods without oral feeding
usually accompanied by severe trauma, burns, sepsis or other major complication
Causes: gallstones (calculous cholecystitis) obstructing the cystic duct, leading to bile stasis and infection
bacterial infection, ischemia, trauma, prolonged fasting, critical illness.
Risk Factors: Female, obesity, high-fat diet, rapid weight loss, pregnancy, hormone therapy, older age, diabetes, prolonged TPN use.Clinical Manifestations: RUQ pain, radiates to right shoulder, worsens after fatty meals, N/V, fever, tachycardia, Murphy’s sign positive, possible jaundice if bile duct obstructed.Blumberg's sign - sharp pain that occurs when pressure is released from the abdomen during a physical examination (ATI)Diagnosis: Ultrasound (first-line), HIDA scan, CT scan, elevated WBC, LFTs (bilirubin, ALP), amylase/lipase if pancreatic involvement.Treatment:

Things to note:
Murphy's Sign - when you press on the RUQ and the patient experiences pain
ERCP - Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography; a medical procedure that combines endoscopy and X-rays to diagnose and treat conditions affecting the bile ducts
ERCP is used to remove gallstones
MRCP - Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, another imaging procedure
Estrogen - fucks up the gallbladder resulting in decreased production of bile salts =&gt; clumping of bile =&gt; blockage
HIDA scan - dye is injected to trace movement in bile ducts, Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid Scan, uses special cameraWhat is it: gallstones formed from cholesterol, bilirubin, or mixed substances in the gallbladder, can be asymptomatic or cause obstruction leading to cholecystitis.
Causes: Imbalance in bile composition (excess cholesterol, bilirubin, or decreased bile salts), bile stasis, gallbladder motility issues.
Risk Factors: Female, obesity, high-fat/low-fiber diet, rapid weight loss, pregnancy, hormone therapy, older age, diabetes, liver disease, prolonged TPN.
Clinical Manifestations: Asymptomatic or biliary colic (RUQ pain, radiates to right shoulder, postprandial, especially after fatty meals), nausea, vomiting, bloating, dyspepsia.
Diagnosis: Ultrasound (first-line), CT scan, MRCP, elevated LFTs if bile duct obstruction, ERCP if common bile duct stones suspected.
Treatment: Asymptomatic—no treatment needed; symptomatic—cholecystectomy (laparoscopic preferred), bile acid dissolution therapy (ursodiol) if surgery contraindicated, ERCP for bile duct stones.
Nursing Considerations: Pain management, monitor for signs of obstruction or infection, educate on diet changes (low-fat, small meals), post-op care after cholecystectomy, assess for complications like pancreatitis or cholangitis.]]></description><link>med-surg/gi/cholecystitis.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Med-Surg/GI/Cholecystitis.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 18:19:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ESRD]]></title><description><![CDATA[End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)

A life-threatening hematologic disorder characterized by simultaneous clotting and bleeding due to widespread activation of the coagulation cascade
Leads to microvascular thrombosis, ischemia, and organ failure, followed by excessive bleeding due to depletion of clotting factors and platelets
usually found in patients who are already in critical condition =&gt; DIC worsens their outcomes
Can be acute (life-threatening) or chronic (low-grade, seen in cancer patients)
DIC = Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Sepsis (most common cause, especially Gram-negative infections)
Severe trauma or burns
Obstetric complications (placental abruption, amniotic fluid embolism, preeclampsia)
Malignancies (leukemia, metastatic cancer)
Major surgery or massive blood transfusion
Severe liver disease (liver produces clotting factors)
Snake venom poisoning Cyanosis or gangrene (due to microthrombi in extremities)
Altered mental status (cerebral ischemia)
Acute kidney injury (renal ischemia)
Respiratory distress (pulmonary embolism, ARDS) Petechiae, ecchymosis, and purpura
bleeding from existing wounds: IV sites, surgical wounds, mucous membranes
Hematuria, hematemesis, melena

life-threatening condition that occurs as a result of circulatory failure
causes decreased SVR and perfusion leads to tissue hypoxia, cellular death, and organ dysfunction
4 Main Types:
Distributive (septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic, toxic) =&gt; vasodilation
Cardiogenic
Hypovolemic
Obstructive
Common Manifestations: tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, abnormal mental status, mottled skin, cold and clammy extremities, oliguria, hyperlactatemia, and metabolic acidosis
Systemic vasodilation
results in decreased perfusion the heart, brain, and kidneys =&gt; eventually organ damage
Capillary fluid leaks into the surrounding tissue causing further clinical deterioration with decreased systemic vascular resistance and abnormal oxygen utilization.
decreased CO, hypotension
Subtypes: septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic, toxic
risk factors: <a data-href="CKD" href="med-surg/gu/ckd.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CKD</a>, lots of lines, immunosuppression, recent surgery, old, cancer release of inflammatory cytokines in the presence of sepsis
cytokines damage blood vessel walls, triggering clotting and forming tiny clots
fluid leaks!
Causes: pancreatitis, burns, HAI
Treatment: abx within 1 hour, IVF (crystalloid - Salt solutions used for fluid replacement that can easily move around the body), norepi to manage BP
Resus: 3-mL/kg first 3 hours of resus severe hypersensitivity reaction that is mediated by IgE
results in the release of chemical mediators such as histamines, prostaglandins, leukotrienes
increases vascular permeability and subsequent decreased SVR, vasodilation, decreased perfusion to vital organs, and bronchoconstriction
Causes: exposure to an allergen (foods, latex, medications, animal venom, insect stings)
signature cue: exposure to an allergen such as medication, food, or insect sting
Manifestations: flushing, edema of the face and mouth, urticaria, hypotension, hoarseness, facial and oral edema, tachypnea, wheezing or stridor
FIRST LINE TX: IM EPI (give first before anything else), keep repeating until symptoms resolve =&gt; hold epi in muscle for 10 sec
remove cause of allergic rxn, IVF (crystalloids), corticosteroids, antihistamines, albuterol
Scenario: if giving abx &amp; patient complains of itchiness and difficulty breathing, do the ff: 1. stop meds, 2. auscultate lungs, 3. epi due to autonomic dysregulation caused by a primary and secondary spinal cord injury above the level of T6,
often associated with trauma to the cervical or thoracic vertebrae.
Primary injury: damage to axons, grey mater, and the anterior root
Secondary injury: causes electrolyte shifts, edema, and a vascular insult that leads to necrosis of the grey matter.
Causes: trauma, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, spinal anesthesia
Manifestations: brady cardia = unique symptom, flushed and warm skin, autonomic dysreflexia, temperature dysregulation, orthostatic hypotension, and bradyarrhythmias
Tx: IV NS ASAP involves infection from Staphylococcus aureus and endotoxins from group A streptococcus
often resulting from the use of nasal or vaginal tampons
Other causes: burns, soft tissue or post-surgical infections, and dialysis catheters
manifestations: hypotension, rash resembling a sunburn, fever, and ultimately organ-failure related to vascular permeability. intravascular volume is decreased, resulting in poor CO
result of blood loss or extracellular fluid loss
25-30% loss of volume
Hemorrhagic shock - insufficient perfusion of blood
inadequate O2 demands =&gt; anaerobic metabolism, by-product: lactic acid (leads to lactic acidosis =&gt; decreased cardiac contractility)
Coagulopathy: impaired coagulation as a result of blood loss
Signature cue: flattened neck veins and orthostatic hypotension
low central venous pressure (normal is 2-6 mmHg)
<br>risk factors: trauma, <a data-href="Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm" href="med-surg/cardiovascular/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</a>, PUD, maternal clients with bleeding risk
Nursing intervention: lower HOB (more perfusion to brain and core)
Note: infuse NS first before vasopressors (do not infuse vasopressors first!)
Put SPO2 on forehead instead of extremities for more accurate
Volume Loss Manifestations by %
&lt;20% loss - anxiety, restlessness
20-40% loss - tachycardia, tachypnea, oliguria (dec. UOP), and orthostatic hypotension
40%+ loss: hypotension, severe tachycardia, and deteriorating mental statusOther manifestations: muscle cramps, thirst, abdominal or chest pain, lethargy, agitation, or confusion, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, cyanosisInternal bleeding symptoms: hematemesis, bloody stool, and abdominal distentionHemorrhagic Causes: trauma, rupture of esophageal varices GI bleed, aneurysm rupture, anticoags
Non-Hemorrhagic causes: excessive diuresis, burns, GI fluid loss, third spacing (ascites, edema, pleural effusion, interstitial shift)Treatment: determine if hemorrhagic or not ASAP
Hemorrhagic: stop the bleed, administer blood products (PRBCs), FFP, plasma, large bor IV
Non-hemo: rapid infusion of warm isotonic crystalloids for a total of 30 mL/kgdo not give vasopressors in hypovolemic shock =&gt; it can worsen tissue perfusion (if given, infuse NS first)
Cardiac dysfunction causes myocardial ischemia =&gt; less CO =&gt; hypoperfusion
Compensatory mechanisms: peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia
Signature cues: chest pain and cardiac arrhythmias, narrowed pulse pressure, rhonchi, and distended jugular veins with elevated pulsations.
Causes: PE, metabolic acidosis, e- imbalance, cardiac nature
risk factors: 75 older, asian, pacific islander, female, DM, CVD, sepsis, obese
Signature manifestations: chest pain, arrhythmias, narrowed pulse pressure, ronchi, distented JV with pulsations
tx: goal is to restore optimal CO; vasopressors (norepi), inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone), IVF, treat cause or mechanical support
Positive Inotropic = more forceful beats, Double D's = Digoxin &amp; Dopamine
Note: Dopamine can cause Tachycardia and Arrythmias (lower dose if this happens)
MCS: mechanical circulatory support. Examples: LVAD, balloon pump (IABP), ECMO, cardiac transplant
blood flow is blocked and circulation to the major organs is disrupted
examples: pulmonary embolism, tension pneumo, mechanical ventilation with high levels of PEEP
other examples: aortic dissection, pericardiac tamponade, pericardiac effusion, mass within heart
other Causes: tension pneumo, ventilation high VEEP, PE
Risk factors: atherosclerotic disease, uncontrolled HTN, coagulopathies resulting in increased clotting, cancer, AIDS, pulmonary HTN, respiratory diseases or surgeries requiring the use of mechanical ventilation, and thoracic trauma.

Initial Stage Patho: Cellular hypoxia leads to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid buildup
S/S: Often subtle; possible mild tachycardia and cool extremities Compensatory Stage Patho: Body activates compensatory mechanisms (SNS activation, RAAS system) to maintain perfusion, "FIGHT OR FLIGHT", peripheral vasoconstriction
S/S: Tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, cool/clammy skin, decreased urine output, altered mental status. Progressive Stage Patho: Compensatory mechanisms fail, resulting in worsening hypoxia and cellular dysfunction
S/S: Hypotension, weak pulses, severe confusion, anuria, metabolic acidosis, cold and clammy skin is priority in this stage Refractory Stage - irreversible Patho: Widespread organ failure with severe hypoxia and cellular death,
S/S: Profound hypotension, unresponsive state, multiple organ dysfunction, death imminent Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) - employed to identify risk of mortality and clinical deterioration based on SBP, RR, HR, mental status, and temperature.Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT)
A dialysis method used in critically ill patients who are unable to tolerate traditional intermittent hemodialysis.

A progressive, life-threatening condition where two or more organ systems fail due to an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response
reversible but deadly =&gt; higher # of organs affected = higher chance of death
leads to longer ICU stay, higher mortality
Often results from sepsis, trauma, burns, or severe illness, leading to widespread tissue hypoxia and organ failure.
Can be primary (direct organ injury) or secondary (resulting from systemic inflammation and shock). Sepsis &amp; septic shock: Most common cause due to overwhelming infection.
Severe trauma: Major burns, crush injuries, or hemorrhagic shock.
Pancreatitis: Triggers systemic inflammation.
Major surgery: Postoperative complications and ischemia-reperfusion injury.
Respiratory failure (ARDS): Leads to oxygen deprivation affecting multiple organs.
Toxic drug reactions: Overdose or chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Advanced age: Poor physiologic reserve.
Chronic illnesses: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure.
Immunosuppression: Cancer, chemotherapy, organ transplantation.
Prolonged ICU stay: Mechanical ventilation, multiple invasive devices.
Severe hypotension: Prolonged shock states leading to ischemia. Respiratory failure: ARDS, hypoxia, need for mechanical ventilation.
Cardiovascular dysfunction: Hypotension, tachycardia, poor perfusion.
Renal failure: Oliguria, increased creatinine, electrolyte imbalances.
Hepatic dysfunction: Jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy.
Neurological changes: Confusion, agitation, decreased LOC, coma.
Metabolic derangements: Lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia, electrolyte disturbances.
Coagulopathy: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), increased bleeding risk Severe hypotension &amp; shock: Progresses to cardiovascular collapse.
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (<a data-href="DIC" href="med-surg/hematological/dic.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DIC</a>): Widespread clotting and bleeding.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Worsening hypoxia and ventilatory failure.
<br>Acute kidney injury (<a data-href="AKI" href="med-surg/gu/aki.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AKI</a>): Requires dialysis in severe cases.
Liver failure: Increased ammonia, encephalopathy, coagulopathy.

Vasopressors (Norepinephrine, dopamine)
<br>Dialysis for <a data-href="AKI" href="med-surg/gu/aki.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">AKI</a>
Sepsis Management: abx, IVF, blood products
Nutritional Support: enteral or parenteral nutrition Monitor for early signs of organ failure (urine output, oxygenation, mental status).
Maintain hemodynamic stability: Monitor BP, HR, CVP, and fluid balance.
Assess for infection: Frequent cultures, temperature monitoring.
Manage mechanical ventilation: Prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Prevent complications: DVT prophylaxis, repositioning to prevent pressure ulcers.

insertion of catheter in peripheral art (usually radial, femoral, brachial), see trends or abrupt changes in BP, frequent lab draws
transducer must be positioned at the level of the midaxillary line at the level of the right atrium when lying in bed
too low: high pressure, too high - low pressure =&gt; all wrong
manual blood pressures can be unsafe due to sudden hemodynamic changes catheter is inserted through the brachial, antecubital, jugular, or femoral vein to connect with the right side of the heart and then proceed to the pulmonary artery
for patients who have cardiogenic shock, pulmonary hypertension, and unexplained dyspnea
Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP) - measure of the pressure in the small blood vessels (capillaries) that lie between the lungs and the left atrium. Reflects left atrial pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP); indicates left heart function and fluid status. Normal Range: 6-12 mmHg.
Normal Range: 6-12 mmHg
pressure in the superior vena cava or right atrium; reflects right ventricular preload and fluid status.
Normal Range: 8 and 12 mm Hg.
central venous access device (CVAP), generally inserted in the internal jugular or subclavian vein and advanced into the superior vena cava at the entrance to the right atrium. Decreases in CVP can be an indication of hypovolemia, blood loss greater than 10%, dilation of the vena cava, or a decrease in intrathoracic pressure
Elevations in CVP can indicate decreased cardiac contractility, dysrhythmias, or abnormal functioning of the cardiac valves, all of which may indicate heart failure

chronic metabolic bone disorder resulting low bone density
the rate of bone resorption (osteoclast cells) exceeds the rate of bone formation (osteoblast cells)
results in fragile bone tissue and can lead to fractures
progressive deterioration of bone tissue
Often asymptomatic until a fracture occurs (common fracture site: wrist, hips, spine)
Osteopenia - precursor to osteoporosis; low bone mineral density relative to the client’s age and sex; bone density peaks at 18-30, decreases gradually, significant decrease in postmenopausal women
Aging (natural loss of bone mass over time)
Hormonal changes (especially estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women)
Males: loss of testosterone =&gt; decreased bone mass
Nutritional deficiencies (calcium, vitamin D)
Non-Modifiable:
Female sex (higher risk than males)
Aging (risk increases after 50)
Family history of osteoporosis or fractures
Caucasian or Asian ethnicity
History of malabsorption disorders (celiac disease, anorexia, bariatric surgery)
male with decreased T levels
Modifiable:
Low calcium and vitamin D intake
Sedentary lifestyle (lack of weight-bearing exercise)
Excess alcohol (decreased bone formation and increased bone absorption)
Excess Caffeine consumption =&gt; increased excretion of calcium in the urine.
Smoking (reduces bone mass)
Long-term corticosteroid use (e.g., prednisone)
Low body weight or eating disorders
High protein or low protein diet
frequent sodas or carbonated drinks - High phosphorus intake increases the rate of calcium loss Often asymptomatic until a fracture occurs
Loss of height over time (due to vertebral compression fractures)
Kyphosis (hunched back, "dowager’s hump")
Back pain from vertebral fractures
Fragility fractures (hip, wrist, vertebrae) from minimal trauma Fractures (hip, spine, and wrist most common)
Chronic pain and disability from fractures
Loss of independence (due to mobility issues)
Increased mortality (hip fractures linked to higher mortality rates) Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Testing (via DEXA scan); T-score ≤ -2.5 confirms osteoporosis
Serum calcium, vitamin D levels (to assess deficiencies)
X-rays (for fractures)
24 hr urine = check Lifestyle Modifications:
Increase calcium intake (1200 mg/day postmenopausal women)
Vitamin D supplements (800-1000 IU/day) =&gt; increases calcium absorption
Weight-bearing exercises (walking, resistance training)
Smoking cessation &amp; limiting alcohol intake
limit caffeine
Medications:
Bisphosphonates (first-line):
Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid (inhibit bone resorption) =&gt; take before breakfast with 8oz water, remain upright for 30 min
Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) (e.g., raloxifene) =&gt; replace estrogen due to menopause (note: high risk of breast, endo cancer, DVT)
Denosumab (monoclonal antibody) for high-risk patients
Calcitonin (less commonly used)
Parathyroid hormone analogs (teriparatide) (stimulates bone formation)
Orthotic Devices - immobilization of the spine immediately after a compression fracture of the spine
Surgery: joint repair, vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty
Educate on fall prevention (home safety modifications, proper footwear, clear walkways, adequate lighting, etc)
Encourage weight-bearing and resistance exercises
Monitor for signs of fractures (sudden pain, loss of function)
Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake
Teach correct administration of bisphosphonates (take on an empty stomach with water, stay upright for 30-60 min) Foods rich in vitamin D are most fish, egg yolks, fortified milk, and cereal.
Foods rich in calcium are milk products, green leafy vegetables, fortified orange juice and cereals, red and white beans, and figs. Some soy and rice products are fortified with vitamin D and calcium. Risk for injury related to fragile bones
Impaired physical mobility due to pain or fractures
Chronic pain related to vertebral fractures
Deficient knowledge related to disease management and prevention

Assessment: Evaluate swallowing ability using bedside swallow screening, noting coughing, drooling, or difficulty managing secretions.
Diet Modification: Implement NPO status if aspiration risk is high, then progress to appropriate texture-modified diets (e.g., pureed, mechanical soft) and thickened liquids as ordered. no thin liquids Positioning: Keep the patient upright at 90° during meals and for 30-60 minutes after eating to reduce aspiration risk.
Swallowing Techniques: Encourage chin tuck, small bites, slow chewing, and alternate solids with liquids to aid swallowing.
Aspiration Precautions: Monitor for coughing, wet voice, increased secretions, or respiratory distress, and implement suctioning if needed.
Oral Care: Provide frequent oral hygiene to reduce bacterial aspiration pneumonia risk.
Collaboration: Work with speech-language pathology (SLP) for swallowing therapy and further evaluation.
Enteral Nutrition Consideration: If oral intake is unsafe, initiate NG or PEG tube feeding per provider order.

A type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals
Uric acid crystals form and deposit in the joints, causing inflammation and pain
Often affects the big toe (podagra), but can involve other joints such as the knees, wrists, and elbows.
Acute episodes of gout may last a few days to weeks and can be triggered by dietary factors, alcohol, dehydration, or trauma. Hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood) due to: excessive production OR reduced excretion
Genetic predisposition (family history of gout)
High purine foods (red meats, shellfish, organ meats)
Alcohol consumption (beer and liquor)
Sugary drinks (high fructose corn syrup)
Excessive intake of processed foods
Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease increase risk.
Medications (e.g., diuretics, low-dose aspirin) can elevate uric acid levels. Male gender (more common in men, especially age 30-50)
Obesity (increased uric acid production)
Chronic kidney disease (decreased excretion of uric acid)
Family history of gout
Medications (diuretics, immunosuppressive drugs)
Hypertension and metabolic syndrome Severe, sudden pain in a joint, most commonly the big toe (podagra)
Swelling, redness, warmth in the affected joint
Pain may be excruciating to touch, with symptoms often occurring at night
Tophi (hard nodules) may form in chronic gout, typically around the joints or ears
Fever in severe cases
Long-term: Tophi formation in joints, tendons, or skin, joint deformities Joint damage and deformities due to long-term uric acid crystal deposition
Kidney stones (due to uric acid buildup in kidneys)
Chronic pain and decreased mobility
Cardiovascular issues (increased risk of hypertension and heart disease)
Tophi formation in soft tissues Joint aspiration (synovial fluid analysis): Identifies uric acid crystals under a microscope.
Blood tests: Elevated serum uric acid levels (although may not be elevated during acute attack).
X-rays: May show joint damage in chronic gout cases or presence of tophi.
Ultrasound: Detects urate crystals in joints and soft tissues.
Acute attack management:
NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) to reduce pain and inflammation
Colchicine (reduces inflammation and pain, especially within the first 24 hours)
Corticosteroids (oral or injected into the joint) for severe cases
Uric acid-lowering drugs:
Allopurinol (reduces uric acid production)
Febuxostat (alternative to allopurinol)
Probenecid (increases uric acid excretion by kidneys)
Lifestyle modifications:
Low-purine diet: Avoid red meats, shellfish, and organ meats
Limit alcohol (especially beer and liquor)
Weight loss (reduces uric acid levels)
Adequate hydration (helps prevent uric acid crystals from forming) Pain management: Administer NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids as prescribed.
Encourage proper hydration: Fluids help in reducing uric acid concentration in the blood.
Monitor serum uric acid levels during treatment.
Education on lifestyle changes
Prevent future attacks: Ensure patient adheres to long-term medications (e.g., allopurinol) and dietary modifications.
Monitor for signs of kidney stones (severe pain, hematuria). Acute pain related to inflammation from uric acid crystals
Impaired physical mobility related to joint pain and swelling
Ineffective health maintenance related to poor dietary habits or medication adherence
Risk for injury related to decreased mobility from joint inflammation

Early Stage: Loss of mobility, reduced desire/ability to eat or drink, cognitive changes (delirium, increased sleep).
Middle Stage: Further mental decline, brief wakefulness, "death rattle" from mucus/saliva pooling due to weak cough reflex.
Late Stage: Fever, apnea, mottled skin from peripheral circulation loss; progression varies from 24 hrs to over 14 days.
Good Death: Typically pain-free, in a preferred location, surrounded by loved ones.
Clinical Death: Heart/lungs stop, but brain remains viable; timely CPR may restore function. Brain damage starts after 4 min without oxygen, death in 4-6 min.
Biologic Death (Brain Death): No brain activity or blood flow; diagnosed by apnea, absent brainstem reflexes, coma from known cause.
Causes of Biologic Death: Intracranial (subarachnoid hemorrhage, TBI) or extracranial (cardiac arrest, inadequate CPR, trauma, drowning, overdose, stroke, aneurysm).
Pathophysiology of Biologic Death: Brain oxygen deprivation → increased edema → raised intracranial pressure → reduced cerebral perfusion → herniation.
Organ Donation: Mechanical support can maintain lung/heart function, but brain death is required for organ donation eligibility. General Changes: Profound weakness, fatigue, increased sleep, disorientation, visions of deceased individuals.
Food &amp; Fluids: Decreased interest in eating/drinking, weight loss, dehydration, difficulty swallowing (choking/coughing).
Urinary Function: Decreased output, urinary incontinence, dark concentrated urine due to low fluid intake.
Skin Changes: Mottling (purple/dark pink in lighter skin, brown in darker skin), pressure injuries from immobility and poor perfusion.
Cardiac &amp; Circulation Changes: Reduced cerebral perfusion (drowsiness, confusion, terminal delirium), peripheral cyanosis, mottling, hypotension, tachycardia, cooling extremities.
Respiratory Changes: Pooling secretions causing "death rattle," weak/absent cough reflex, dyspnea, Cheyne-Stokes respirations (shallow, rapid breathing with apnea periods). Absence of resp, HR, responsiveness, voluntary movement, muscle function, and nervous system activity
Complete muscle relaxation
Algor mortis causes body cooling, pale skin, and loss of turgor
Rigor mortis causes muscle stiffness, beginning within 2-6 hours and peaking at 12 hours
Livor mortis causes blood pooling in dependent areas, leading to purple or reddish discoloration, which becomes fixed after 6-12 hours Specialized care for clients with serious illnesses to improve quality of life. Treatment Approach: Can include symptom management alongside or instead of curative treatments. Client Support: Helps clients understand treatment options and make informed choices. Interprofessional Team: Includes nurses, social workers, dietitians, chaplains, and providers; tailored to client needs. Goals: Supports clients in living actively until death, focusing on comfort and symptom control. Common Symptoms Managed: Dyspnea and pain are primary concerns. Early Implementation Benefits: More effective when started early, reducing unnecessary hospitalizations.
Palliative Sedation Used for terminally ill or actively dying clients with distressing symptoms Relieves pain, agitation, and anxiety to prevent unnecessary suffering Not intended to hasten death Common medications: opiates, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics Risks: respiratory depression, aspiration, delirium-related agitation Requires informed consent from the client or legal proxy Must align with advanced directives if applicable Definition: Focuses on comfort, quality of life, and support for clients nearing the end of life.
Eligibility: For clients with a terminal illness, typically with a prognosis of fewer than six months, though it can be extended.
Care Approach: Provides comfort care rather than curative treatment.
Settings: Can be provided at home, in hospitals, hospice centers, or nursing homes.
Interprofessional Team: Offers medical, emotional, physical, spiritual, and social support.
Home Hospice: Primarily managed by family and friends with hospice team support.
Respite Care: Temporary relief for caregivers to prevent burnout.
Nursing Role: Collaborates with clients, families, and the care team to honor patient wishes and provide education.
Palliative vs. Hospice Care Comparison
Palliative Care: Provided alongside curative treatments or as symptom management
Can begin at any stage of a serious illness
Aims to improve quality of life and relieve symptoms
Available in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes Hospice Care: For clients with a terminal illness, typically with a prognosis of ≤6 months
Focuses on comfort rather than curative treatment
Provided at home, in hospice centers, hospitals, or nursing homes
Primarily managed by family with hospice team support Both: Aim to improve quality of life
Use an interprofessional team for medical, emotional, social, and spiritual support
Manage symptoms such as pain and dyspnea
Respect client autonomy and end-of-life wishes Identifying Potential Donors: Clients must meet brain death criteria (irreversible loss of all brain function).
Brain death is confirmed through apnea, known-cause coma, and absent brainstem reflexes.
Clients near death (not brain dead) may still be assessed for potential donation. Organs &amp; Tissues Eligible for Donation: Organs: Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, pancreas, intestines.
Tissues: Corneas, middle ear, heart valves, bone, veins, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, skin.
Other Donations: Hands, face, bone marrow, cord blood, blood stem cells, blood, platelets.
Live Organ Donation: One kidney, one lung, part of the liver, pancreas, or intestine. Assessment &amp; Scoring: CGS: Score of 3 with the absence of at least three brainstem reflexes indicates imminent brain death.
FOUR Score: Evaluates respiration, eye response, brainstem response, and motor response (score of 0 suggests brain death). Nurse’s Role in Brain Death &amp; Donation Process: Assess and document brainstem reflexes and neurological status.
Maintain circulation and respiratory function with mechanical ventilation and vasopressors.
Work closely with the organ donation coordinator to evaluate donor suitability.
Shift care focus from treatment of the client to organ preservation. Priorities in Donor Care: Maintain a patent airway and normal body temperature.
Ensure adequate oxygenation and perfusion of organs.
Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance to prevent complications. Family Communication &amp; Support: Nurses play a key role in discussing organ donation due to their relationship with the family.
Use clear, compassionate communication, explaining brain death and prognosis.
Respect cultural and spiritual beliefs regarding death and organ donation.
Families are more likely to consent when they experience compassion, commitment, and clear information. Education &amp; Training for Nurses: Ongoing training on organ donation, brain death criteria, grief counseling, and facility protocols.
Sensitivity to the death and dying process is crucial. Pain &amp; Symptom Management: Assess and manage pain, dyspnea, agitation, and secretions using medications (opioids, benzodiazepines, anticholinergics).
Comfort Care: Reposition frequently, provide skin care, and use moisture barriers to prevent breakdown. Keep the client clean, dry, and comfortable.
Respiratory Support: Elevate the head of the bed, use oxygen if needed for comfort, and provide suctioning or anticholinergic medications for excessive secretions.
Emotional &amp; Psychological Support: Offer reassurance, provide presence, and support the client and family emotionally. Encourage open discussions about end-of-life wishes.
Communication: Speak softly, use simple phrases, and ensure the client and family understand changes occurring. Provide honest but compassionate information.
Hydration &amp; Nutrition: Do not force food or fluids; provide oral care to prevent dryness and cracking of lips. Use ice chips or moistened swabs for comfort.
Urinary &amp; Bowel Care: Monitor for incontinence, use absorbent pads, provide perineal care, and consider catheterization if needed.
Skin Integrity: Turn and reposition frequently, use pressure-relieving devices, and assess for skin breakdown.
Cultural &amp; Spiritual Considerations: Respect religious or cultural practices related to death and dying; involve chaplains or spiritual leaders as requested.
Family Support: Encourage family presence, educate about the dying process, and provide opportunities to say goodbye. Offer grief resources.
Postmortem Care: Respect cultural practices, clean the body, remove tubes (unless an autopsy is required), and prepare the body for the family’s final moments.

type of blood clot that forms in large veins of extremities or pelvis
usually occurs in lower extremities
3rd most common cause of death among cardiovascular disorders
DVT will go unnoticed but can dislodge and result in a pulmonary embolus, a life-threatening event
Types: provoked: from an acquired cause (obesity, cancer, immobility)
unprovoked: from an endogenous cause such as recurrence
Proximal: above the knee, and this type is more likely to cause complications leading to PE
Distal: below the knee (most common) pain, redness, swelling, warmth at affected extremity**
edema no longer recommended: DVT filters on inferior vena cava
Prophylaxis: SCD, Xa inhibitors (Eliquis, newer class) ambulate early
anticoags
administer Lovenox - low molecular weight heparin injection
conduct "wells criteria test" - establish DVT risk venous doppler - detects bloow flow
venography - invasive procedure involving contrast dye and xray
d-dimer
MRI caused by damage to the wall of a blood vessel
turbulence to blood flow, such as with atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia
hypercoagulability, meaning the blood is increasingly coagulating or clotting
decreased blood flow due to immobility, surgery, catheter
dehydration due to increased blood viscosity
genetics - factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation
CHF, COPD
hospital stay immobility: bedrest, airplane right, anesthesia
hormonal: pregnant, contraceptive therapy or hormone replacement therapy with estrogen

What is it
Blood clots are made up of platelets and fibrin and are a gel-like consistency
thrombus - when blocks vein or artery arterial thrombosis - occurs in artery
venous Embolus/embolism - if it moves throughout the body; can cause serious harm
Subtypes
Pulmonary Embolism
Myocardial Infarction (MI)
Ischemic Stroke - occurs in artery to the brain caused by plaque (fatty deposits)
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
Clinical Presentation chest pain that worsens with deep breathing tachycardia, SOB, lightheadedness, hemoptysis MI: chest pain radiating left arm, SOB, diaphoresis Stroke: facial weakness, difficulty speaking, visual deficit, L/R sided weakness, seizures
Treatment Thrombolytics - class of meds that dissolve clots Tissue Plasminogen Activator - give within 3 hours for stroke, do not use with hemorrhagic stroke, verify with CT Thrombectomy - specialized instruments to surgically remove a blood clot Prevention: Coumadin/Warfarin - avoid diet changes, monitor INR, high K diet contradicts this medication
Factor Xa Inhibitors - Eliquis, monitoring not required, oral
Lovenox/Enoxaparin
Heparin - Hold heparin if the platelet count is less than 100,000/mm, monitor aPTT
Plavix/Clopidogrel
Antiplatelets - ensures platelets do not stick together most common: aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), usually prescribed with ACS Nursing Interventions ambulate diet note aging adults challenges <br>
be on alert with anticoagulants <a href=".?query=tag:anticoagulant" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#anticoagulant">#anticoagulant</a> higher risk for bleeding
Warfarin - needs INR, diet restrictions Causes/Risk Factors
injury or damage to vein
surgery exacerbated by bed rest
hormonal: oral contraceptives, pregnancy, hormone replacement, estrogen (menopause, prostate cancer)
child birth after first 3 months
smoking
cancers: lungs, brain, pancreas, uterus, ovaries, blood cancers, chemotherapy
family history
Atrial Fibrillation
Infection
mechanical heart valves
SSC - systemic sclerosis, aka "scleroderma": also provides increased risk for clots
Diagnosis
D-dimer test: blood test, high = clot. can also be present during pregnancy or postop small fragment of protein is detected from blood clot
not definitive, more testing needed if positive CT, US, MRA (magnetic resonance angiography) MRA = more specific to blood vessels V/Q scan - ventilation/perfusion test aided by radioactive and imaging techniques
Systemic Effects
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) - profoundly serious health condition clotting and anticlotting mechanisms occur at the same time What is it
Hemorrhage: Loss of blood from damaged vessels, inside or outside the body.
Severity impacts treatment and prognosis.
Blood loss classess: Class I - 0-15%
Class II - 15-30% (shock symptoms apparent)
Class III - 30-40% (delayed cap refill, SBP&lt;90, tachy)
Class IV - 40% or more, no UOP, peripheral pulses absent, shock Types of Hemorrhages:
Intracranial - brain bleeds
Pulmonary - hemothorax; caused by trauma, cancer, or clotting
Stroke - hemorrhagic; vessels rupture and blood leaks into brain
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms vary: nausea, dizziness, cool skin, shortness of breath, weakness, tachycardia, confusion.
Internal bleeding signs: hemoptysis, hematemesis, clammy skin, abdominal rigidity, altered consciousness.
<br>intracranial hemorrhage: <a href=".?query=tag:stroke" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#stroke">#stroke</a> headaches, slurred speech or difficulty speaking, facial numbness, upper and lower extremity weakness or numbness, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, or difficulty with ambulating Treatment
IV fluids, blood transfusion, oxygen therapy, warming blankets, emotional support.
Type and cross-match for blood products.
Physical and occupational therapy for rehabilitation.
Nursing Interventions
Goal: stop the bleed
Assess and identify bleeding source, apply pressure, ensure IV access, administer fluids.
Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and mental status.
Educate on gradual activity increase and rest.
MAP &gt; 65 mm Hg indicates adequate cardiac perfusion.
MAP = (DBP×2) + SBP /3Diagnostic Tools
CBC, platelet count, PT, PTT.
CT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds
endoscopy for suspected GI bleeds.
Causes
Traumatic injuries, cancer, clotting disorders, elevated BP leading to ruptured aneurysm.
Risk Factors
Trauma, accidents, cancer
blood clotting disorders: hemophillia (genetic mutation)
poor people = higher risk
postpartum hemorrhage = atony (flaccid fetus due to significant blood loss during childbirth or postpartum period)
Systemic Effects
Hypovolemic shock: decreased cardiac output, circulatory insufficiency, hypoxemia.
Cognitive impairments, fatigue, depression, anxiety, PTSD.
Orthostatic hypotension increases fall risk.

T3/T4 causes increased expression of B-adrenergic receptors (causing increased FIGHT OR FLIGHT response) Graves' disease (autoimmune, most common) - immune system gets confused and tells thyroid to go wild, making you jittery, sweaty, and giving you bulging eyes (grave's ophthalmopathy)
Toxic multinodular goiter - lumps (nodules) on your thyroid start making too much thyroid hormone
Thyroid adenoma (benign tumor)
Excess iodine intake (contrast dyes, medications, seaweed)
Overuse of levothyroxine Female, ages 20–40 (sexist!)

Diarrhea, increased bowel movements
menstrual changes Thyroid storm (life-threatening crisis) - aka thyrotoxicosis Fever, extreme tachycardia, hypertensive crisis (180/100)
AMS (big one) Delirium, seizures, dysrhythmias, shock, aneurysm
Requires ICU care: IV beta-blockers, cooling, PTU or methimazole Atrial fibrillation, heart failure =&gt; blood clots, stroke, or heart failure
menstrual cycle disruption (fertility problems)
Osteoporosis from increased bone turnover Elevated: T3, T4 - thyroid produces excess amounts; these hormones are responsible for metabolism, HR, BP, temp, growth, muscle/bone health
Decreased: TSH (if primary hyperthyroidism) Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is reduced because of negative feedback, thyroid is already overstimulated
Other labs: Radioactive iodine uptake scan (↑ uptake in Graves’)

Methimazole - can cause liver toxicity, hypothyroidism if overmedicated
SSKI - Potassium Ioidide, shrinks the thyroid
Beta-blockers (Propranolol for symptom control)
Radioactive iodine therapy (destroys thyroid tissue in one dose) - very toxic, ensure (-) pregnancy, remove jewelry/dentures, no anesthesia, NPO
<br>Thyroidectomy (for severe cases, requires lifelong levothyroxine) - removal of part or entire thyroid, high risk for hypocalcemia <a data-href="Fluid Electrolyte Cheat Sheets" href="med-surg/x-other-systems/fluids-&amp;-acid-base/fluid-electrolyte-cheat-sheets.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fluid Electrolyte Cheat Sheets</a> Monitor for thyroid storm (high fever, extreme tachycardia)
PTU is contraindicated for pregnant

Grape eyes = use eye patches or tape the eyelids
Educate on taking antithyroid meds at same time daily
Monitor for signs of hypothyroidism after treatment
High-calorie, high-protein diet due to increased metabolism (4000-500 cal per day)
Frequent meals
Avoid: caffeine, fiber, spicy food, iodine
NCLEX/ATI: Post-thyroidectomy care includes monitoring for airway swelling, keeping a trach kit at bedside, and assessing for hypocalcemia (Chvostek’s, Trousseau’s signs) due to accidental parathyroid removal

What is it: little pockets in your gut that get inflamed (diverticula) that form in the walls of the colon, typically in the sigmoid colon, occur in areas of weakness along the intestinal tract
Causes: Fecal matter or bacteria becoming trapped in the diverticula, leading to inflammation or infection
Risk Factors: constant straining (chronic constipation) =&gt; more pressure, age, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, low fiber diet, steroids, opioids, NSAIDS
Clinical Manifestations: abdominal pain, fever, N/V, bloating, tenderness, possible rectal bleeding
Diagnosis: CT, CBC (infection), colonoscopy (r/o other conditions)
Treatment: abx, NPO (bowel rest) followed by clear liquid diet, <a data-href="Analgesia" href="pharmacology/analgesia/analgesia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Analgesia</a> but no NSAIDS, surgery for complications (perforations, abscess, fistulas) avoid NSAIDS
assess bowel sounds
hydrate
avoid enemas and laxatives during inflammation
avoid seeds, nuts, popcorn
if no inflammation, high fiber diet is encouraged Nuts and Seeds: These can get trapped in the diverticula and cause irritation or infection (though current research suggests this may not always be true for everyone).
Popcorn: Similar to nuts and seeds, popcorn kernels can irritate diverticula.
Corn: Whole kernels can potentially get stuck in diverticula and cause issues.
Fruits and Vegetables with Small Seeds: Such as strawberries, raspberries, and tomatoes, which might irritate the diverticula.
Spicy Foods: Can irritate the digestive tract and increase inflammation.
High-Fat Foods: Fried foods, fatty meats, and full-fat dairy can slow digestion and worsen symptoms.
Refined Grains: White bread, pasta, and rice lack fiber and may worsen constipation, increasing pressure on the colon.
Processed Meats: Bacon, sausage, and other high-fat, processed meats can contribute to inflammation.

Location: Gastric ulcer affects the stomach; ulcerative colitis affects the colon and rectum.
Cause: Gastric ulcer is mainly due to acid damage; ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune condition.
Symptoms: Gastric ulcer pain is meal-related; ulcerative colitis presents with chronic diarrhea and blood in stool.
Treatment Approach: Gastric ulcer focuses on acid suppression; ulcerative colitis requires immune modulation. open sores that occur in the inner lining of the stomach
ATI says they are synonymous with PEPTIC ULCERS or PUD
damaged protective mucosa is exposed to gastric juices =&gt; stomach tissue is dissolved (severe pain)
H. pylori colonizes mucosa causing inflammation and increased acidity H.Pylori Infection
NSAID use
lifestyle: smoking, alcohol
cystic fibrosis, hyperparathyroidism, Zollinger Ellison
rare: viral infections chemo, cronhs, gastric/lung cancers, vascular insufficiencies family history
liver, kidney or lung disease
Blood type O
rheumatoid arthritis abdominal pain: burning sensation, gnawing = after meals or at night (due to acid irritating the ulcer)
weight loss, nausea, vomiting, feeling bloated, and early satiety perforation - biggest concern as it can cause bleeding and infection
bleeding late signs: hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, SOB, bloody emesis or stool, anemia

What is it: classified under the umbrella term known as an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may demonstrate patches of inflammation followed by patches of healthy tissue
Causes: Exact cause unknown; likely involves immune system dysfunction, genetic predisposition, and environmental triggers.
Risk Factors: Family history, smoking, high-fat diet, NSAID use, stress, and exposure to Westernized diet/lifestyle.
Clinical Manifestations: Abdominal pain (usually RLQ), chronic diarrhea (sometimes bloody), weight loss, fatigue, malnutrition, fever, oral ulcers, and perianal disease (fissures, abscesses, fistulas).
Diagnosis: colonoscopy with biopsy, CT, MRI, fecal calprotectin (inflammation marker), blood tests (elevated CRP, anemia, vitamin deficiencies).
Treatment: Anti-inflammatory meds (<a data-href="5-ASA" href="pharmacology/gi-meds/5-asa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">5-ASA</a>, corticosteroids), immunosuppressants (azathioprine, methotrexate), biologics (TNF inhibitors like infliximab), antibiotics for infections, surgery if complications arise (resections, fistula repair).
Nursing Considerations: Monitor for malnutrition, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances; provide dietary support (low-fiber during flares, high-calorie/protein intake); assess for medication side effects (infection risk with immunosuppressants); encourage smoking cessation and stress management. Watch for complications like strictures, perforation, and abscesses. What is it: also under IBD, continuous inflammation and ulcers in the colon and rectum.
Causes: Unknown; thought to involve genetic, immune, and environmental factors.
Risk Factors: Family history, autoimmune disorders, high-fat diet, smoking (increased risk in non-smokers).
Clinical Manifestations: cramping, urgency, tenesmus, weight loss, fatigue, fever, anemia, sores can bleed = bloody diarrhea
Diagnosis: Colonoscopy with biopsy (shows continuous inflammation, ulcers), stool tests, blood tests (elevated CRP, anemia).
<br>Treatment: Anti-inflammatory meds (<a data-href="5-ASA" href="pharmacology/gi-meds/5-asa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">5-ASA</a>), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics (TNF inhibitors), surgery (colectomy if severe).

What is it:
Blockage in the intestines preventing normal passage of food, gas, and fluid
can be partial, complete, occurring in SMALL or LARGE intestine
Causes:
Mechanical: Tumors, adhesions (scar tissue), hernias, volvulus (twisted bowel), impacted stool, diverticulitis
Non-mechanical&nbsp;(paralytic ileus): Loss of normal bowel movement due to nerve or muscle problems (e.g., after surgery, electrolyte imbalances).
Risk Factors: Previous abdominal surgery (adhesions), cancer/tumors, Crohn's, hernias, constipation, old
Clinical Manifestations: abdominal pain, bloating/distention,&nbsp;NO BOWEL SOUNDS, vomiting (can smell like shit), constipation, dehydration, e- imbalance

inflammation of the liver Viral hepatitis: Caused by Hep ABCDE
Autoimmune hepatitis: Immune system attacks liver cells (less common)
Toxic hepatitis: Due to alcohol, drugs, or toxins. (less common)
Metabolic hepatitis: Related to fatty liver diseases (e.g., MASLD).

Hepatitis Virus - ABCDE
most common: ABC
A = ass to mouth (oral-fecal)
B &amp; C = blood and cum (bloodborne &amp; sexual transmission)
D = double dip (needs B infection first)
E = exit through the ass (oral-fecal) vary depending on type
A &amp; E- poor sanitation, oral-fecal route, close contact, drug use, seggs, travel to endemic areas, contaminated food
B - unprotected seggs, multiple partners (ho life), needles, mother to child, healthcare workers, tattoos, close proximity
C = same as B, lower risk from seggs
Common risk factors: older adults, immunocompromised, alcohol abuse, preexisting liver conditions jaundice of eyes and skin = buildup of bilirubin N/V
abdominal pain, swelling
fever, fatigue, loss of appetite
dark urine = bilirubin in urine
clay-colored stool (white or gray shit =&gt; lack of bile = no bilirubin as it is normally excreted in stool)
pruritus - buildup of bile salts in skin
muscle/joint pain = B/C
SEVERE: significant weight loss, uncontrolled N/V, confusion/drowsiness, bruising easily, severe abdominal pain <br><a data-href="Cirrhosis" href="med-surg/gi/hepatic/cirrhosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cirrhosis</a> =&gt; read this as these two are related

<br><a data-href="Coags" href="foundations/labs/coags.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Coags</a> = liver is responsible for clotting factors Hepatitis A = no treatment; supportive care only; resolves on its own
B &amp; C = interferon for 6 months (proteins produced naturally by immune system for viruses)
Direct Acting Antivirals = Hep C
not allowed: alcohol, tylenol risk for malnutrition (sarcopenia = loss of muscle from low protein intake)
encourage smaller more frequent meals to reduce upset stomach
Ascites = compute caloric calculations with ideal weight instead of including ascites weight
risk for hyponatremia = very common
risk for thrombocytopenia = low platelets, BLEEDING PRECAUTIONS, no shaving, no hard-bristle toothbrush or dental floss, no aspirin/NSAID, check for signs of bleeding, falls precautions
Educate on diet
encourage vaccination

Fluid Volume Excess: Ascites and edema from portal hypertension and decreased albumin.
Imbalanced Nutrition: Less than Body Requirements: Inadequate intake and malabsorption due to liver dysfunction.
Risk for Infection: Impaired immune function and potential for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhosis.
Acute Pain: Abdominal discomfort from liver inflammation, ascites, or liver capsule distension.
Disturbed Thought Processes: Hepatic encephalopathy from toxin buildup affecting brain function.
Fatigue: Decreased liver function and metabolic changes cause physical exhaustion.
Impaired Skin Integrity: Risk of skin breakdown from edema, pruritus, or jaundice.
Risk for Impaired Liver Function: Further liver damage due to ongoing inflammation, alcohol, or medication use.
Anxiety: Psychological stress from chronic illness, uncertainty, and potential complications.

GFR measures how well the kidneys are filtering blood, specifically the volume of blood that passes through the glomeruli (kidney's filtering units) per minute.
Normal GFR for a healthy adult is typically around 90–120 mL/min/1.73m², and it can vary based on age, gender, and body size.
A decrease in GFR indicates impaired kidney function, which is crucial in diagnosing and staging Chronic Kidney Disease (<a data-href="CKD" href="med-surg/gu/ckd.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">CKD</a>).
Just note that normal GFR is ≥ 90
Guiding Treatment Decisions: Changes in GFR guide adjustments in medication (e.g., dosages of renally cleared drugs) and lifestyle modifications.
Monitoring Complications: Low GFR can lead to complications like fluid retention, electrolyte imbalances, and uremia, all of which require close monitoring and management.
Preventing Progression: Nurses use GFR to track kidney function over time and assess the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., blood pressure control, blood sugar management) in preventing further damage.

Onset: 15-30 minutes
Peak: 1–2 hours
Duration: 3–5 hours
Given before meals to control postprandial blood sugar spikes
ASSPART = move you ass, this is fast
REGULAR or SHORT-acting insulin (e.g., Regular insulin, Humulin R, Novolin R)
Onset: 30–60 minutes
Peak: 2–4 hours
Duration: 4-12 hours
Often used in hospital settings for acute control.
Intermediate-acting insulin (e.g., NPH - aka CLOUDY insulin) =&gt; N = not fast
Onset: 1–2 hours
Peak: 4–12 hours
Duration: 14-24 hours
slower release, kind of like regular gas, but with a longer burn time =&gt; basal control
usually taken twice a day
never IV
Long-acting insulin (e.g., Glargine/Lantus, Detemir)
Onset: 1–2 hours
Peak: No pronounced peak
Duration: Up to 24 hours
Provides basal insulin coverage, typically administered once daily.
Premixed insulin
A combination of short or rapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulins.
Given for those who require both rapid and basal control with fewer injections. commonly mixed: NPH (intermediate) and Regular (short acting)
ROLL THE VIAL for CLOUDY - do not shake
clean with alcohol swab
Lantus cannot be mixed with anything
NR-RN: I am NOT RETIRED, I am an R-N
insert AIR ONLY in order : NPH first, then Regular (not-retired)
once air is inside on both vials, proceed to draw from pressurized vials
Draw in order R-N: Regular first, NPH last
Alternative way of remembering: Cloudy to clear, clear to cloudy (air then draw)
Subcutaneous injection (most common) - rotate sites regularly (abdomen, upper arms, thighs, or buttocks)
Insulin pump (continuous infusion)
Rotation of injection sites (avoid lipodystrophy)
Check blood sugar levels before administration (to adjust dose accordingly).
Vials vs. pens (insulin pens are easier for patients and caregivers to use).
Correct storage (refrigerate unused insulin, do not freeze). Blood glucose monitoring before meals and at bedtime (typically 4 times a day, but can vary).
A1C levels (target: &lt;7% for most patients).
Signs of hypoglycemia (shakiness, sweating, confusion, dizziness, headache).
Signs of hyperglycemia (increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision).
Monitor for signs of insulin resistance (requiring dose adjustment). Mild hypoglycemia (BG &lt;70 mg/dL): Consume 15-20g of quick-acting carbohydrate (e.g., 4 oz fruit juice, 3–4 glucose tablets).
Severe hypoglycemia: Administer glucagon (IM) or 25–50mL of D50 (IV) if unconscious or unable to ingest oral glucose.
Recheck BG after 15 minutes and repeat treatment if needed. Signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and how to respond to each.
Insulin self-administration technique (rotation of injection sites, proper needle disposal).
Dietary management (counting carbs, meal timing).
Exercise considerations (adjusting insulin doses based on activity levels).
Stress management (stress can raise blood sugar).
Glucagon use (for patients at risk of severe hypoglycemia).
Importance of regular follow-up (A1C checks, eye exams, kidney function). Adjust insulin doses based on current blood glucose levels, meal plans, and physical activity.
Ensure proper patient education on the correct insulin use, lifestyle changes, and recognizing symptoms of hypo/hyperglycemia.
Monitor for complications such as infection at injection sites or delayed wound healing.
Assist with managing insulin pumps (ensure proper site placement, troubleshoot equipment).
Coordinate care with dietitians and endocrinologists for individualized care plans.

abnormal build-up of fluid in lungs, specifically in interstitial spaces and alveoli <a href=".?query=tag:pulmonaryedema" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#pulmonaryedema">#pulmonaryedema</a> backup of blood into the pulmonary vasculature is a result of inadequate left ventricular function life-threatening condition associated with CHF (left ventricle)
can also occur as a exacerbation of CHF or after an MI
Flash Pulmonary Edema - sudden rise in left sided heart filling pressure.Clinical Presentation
similar with cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic
pink frothy sputum, chest pain
SOB, tachypneic, hypoxic, distress
confusion, agitation, sweating, cyanosis, cold extremities
hypertension with JVD (hypotension can be a late sign from cardiogenic shock)
tachycardia
pedal edema
weight gain
Treatment
O2 titration (goal: &gt;90% usually to preserve vasoconstriction or cardiac output)
proper positioning (semi-fowler): for lung expansion and venous return
control anxiety
diuretics - furosemide
vasodilators PRN - nitro
monitor I/O
Nursing Considerations &amp; Interventions
proper positioning to promote reduction of venous return
encourage mobility for faster recovery, airway clearance
lifestyle changes
commode at bedside for diuresis
Complications &amp; Other Systemic Effects
respiratory failure (often requiring vent)
ARDS
acidosis
Causes
Cardiogenic P.E CHF, MI, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, cardiac arrythmia Non-Cardiogenic P.E. - other causes kidney injury
chronic hypertension d/t renal artery stenosis (vascular disease) Risk Factors
one year survival rate of 50%
more common in males
elderly
HF or acute decompensated heart failure (worsening manifestations of HF)
CHF, MI, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, cardiac arrythmia
Diagnosis
rule out anemia and sepsis - CBC

defined by apneic episodes caused by repetitive upper airway obstructions, then arousal causing individual to reopen airway and resume breathing
leads to poor sleep, loud snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness secondary effect: memory, learning, decision making Detailed pathophysiology:
tongue - huge factor, most common structure associated with
decreased muscle tone of nasopharynx decreases during sleep
Signs and Symptoms:
loud snoring with breathing cessation for 10 seconds or longer, following by loud snore (arousal)
may have 1-500 episodes per night
incidence increases as weight increases
daytime: chronic fatigue, irritability, moodiness, headache, sleepiness, decreased libido nighttime: snoring, gasping, fragmented sleep, nocturia, insomnia, night sweats Diagnostic Studies:
history and physical exam
PSG - polysomnographic test: records brain waves/EEG, blood oxygen, HR, RR, EMG, ECG gold standard for dx of OSA
airflow is also measured, with breathing patterns
calculated apnea-hypoapnea index (AHI) = # of apneas per hour Treatment:
mandibular advancement device: prevents tongue and soft tissue from blocking airway
CPAP: one pressure setting continuously, decreases work of breathing, prevents airway collapse
BiPAP: different pressures on exhale/inhale, for removing CO2, more complex settings
Surgical: tonsillectomy
resection of pharyngeal soft tissue
partial removal of soft palate and uvula
nasal septoplasty
maxillofacial surgeries Medications: Modafinil (Provigil) reduces daytime sleepiness inhibits dopamine reuptake
adverse: anxiety, HA, nausea Protriptyline (Triptil) - increases respiratory drive, improves airway muscle tone taken at bedtime
also an antidepressant (tricyclic antidepressant)
adverse: anxiety, confusion, headache
taken with CPAP/BiPAP Nursing responsibilities:
facilitate effective sleep environment: dim lights, draw curtains, door slightly closed
provide humidified O2, reposition to one side, encourage deep breathing exercises
elevate head of bed
encourage lifestyle changes: smoking cessation, weight
Risk Factors
obesity
larger neck circumference
high fat around pharynx
nasal congestion
thickened pharyngeal walls
facial malformations
most common in overweight to obese
Effects on Health (other diseases it can lead to):
systemic HTN, cardiac arythmia, heart failure, stroke, MI
contributes to cognitive deficits: irritability, errors, accidents, moodiness, depression
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
daytime drowsiness, loss of independence
Aging adult considerations:
more contributing factors: loss of teeth, muscle dysfunction, other comorbidities (stroke, dementia, HF, edema)
sleepiness may be attributed to old age vs OSA symptom ]]></description><link>med-surg/respiratory/osa.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Med-Surg/Respiratory/OSA.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 19:53:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[GI Bleed]]></title><description><![CDATA[

stomach muscles don't work properly coz your nerves are fucked up
aka, gastropathy; "paralysis of stomach muscles"
affects movement of the muscles of the stomach caused by neurological dysfunction
chronic disorder that results in the delay or even absence of gastric emptying
food can harden in stomach because of lack of stomach movement damage to the vagus nerve
usually complication of other diseases that affect the nerves
Diabetes: #1 cause (chronic high blood sugar levels can damage the vagus nerve)
other examples: surgery complications, autoimmune diseases, MS, hypothyroidism, stroke, myasthenia gravis, Parkinson's
side effects of meds: opioids, CCBs, marijuana, tricyclic antidepressants long term use of opioids and antidepressants
cytomegalovirus, eppestein-barr, varicella, chagas
anorexia, bulimia early satiety, bloating
nausea, vomiting
abdominal pain
acid reflux, decrease in level of energy, lack of appetite, or weight loss. Gastric emptying test (Scintigraphy) = gold standard, xray with dyes; to trace how fast food is moved from stomach
EGD - esophagogastroduodenoscopy - tube with camera; most common =&gt;sedated procedure
gastric emptying breath test (GEBT) - noninvasive, no radiation antidopaminergic agents: Reglan, Motilium, stimulate muscles of GI tract
abx - promotes gastric emptying
antiemetics - zofran/odanzetron diabetes patients: can go into DKA or HHS
palpate abdomen for distention
encourage more fluids (higher risk of dehydration)
encourage lifestyle mods

Long-Acting Anti-Cholinergic Agents (e.g., ipratropium/albuterol, tiotropium): Relieve symptoms, reduce inflammation.
Adverse reactions: urinary retention, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, respiratory issues.Systemic Effects
perfusion - can lead to hypoxemia
neurological - damaged brain cells d/t hypoxemia, leads to death memory loss, poor judgement, inattentiveness, decreased muscle coordination Renal - hypoxemia leads to decreased renal tissue perfusion =&gt; fluid, electrolyte imbalance
Mobility - impaired QOL, worse health outcomes
Risk Factors:
genetics
tobacco exposure
environmental particulates, allergens, infections, pollution
chemicals, perfume, candles, changing weather
allergic sensitization - repeated exposure to allergen increases risk
obesity
more common in males prior to puberty, but opposite after
Phenotypes or Subcategories of Asthma:
Allergic Asthma most common
begins in childhood usually accompanied by family hx of allergic disorders/exczema Nonallergic Asthma less common
common in adults, rare in children
poor response to treatment other than corticosteroids Aspirin-sensitive Asthma flare-up when taking aspirin or NSAIDs
accompanied by chronic rhinitis or nasal inflammation Exercise-Induced Asthma if client exercises to a certain capacity, they will flare up
managed by pre and post meds Comorbidities:
obesity can exacerbate SOB
rhinitis
vocal cord dysfunction (voice box does not open correctly)
GERD
OSA rapid onset asthma attack
severe asthma
Emergency! Very life-threatening
potential acute ventilatory failure or death (d/t hypoxia or hypercapnia)
requires ventiation
10% mortality rate in ICU
Important: give bronchodilator first before oxygenRisk Factors:
poor recognition of dyspnea
usually have other comorbidities
previous episode of S.A., prior intubation
CAD as a result of adverse reactions from meds
Impact:
airways close prematurely when the client exhales leading to an increase in the volume that remains in the lung (functional residual capacity) and air trapping
leads to hypoxemia that then causes lactic acidosis
stress of having asthma coupled with comorbidities that are associated with it can lead to increases in asthmatic episodes
respiratory system of the aging adult undergoes physiological changes and can mimic the presence of airway obstruction
Signs/Symptoms:
SOB, unable to speak full sentences
chest tightness
accessory muscle use
late signs: drowsiness, confusion, cyanosis
sx do not develop at the same time
mucus plug can lead to asphyxia
resp acidosis
wheezing may not be present on auscultation absent wheezes = indicate retained secretions and deteriorating respiratory function Alkalosis if hyperventilating
Diagnostic:
breath sounds
SPO2
ABG
BP - monitor for pulsus paradoxus (When blood pressure drops by more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration.)
LOC &amp; fatigue
PEFR - peak expiratory flow rate; if less than 50% of best = status asthmaticus
PEV
CBC - check for WBC elevation
Systemic Effects:
Perfusion - decreased left ventricular filling and outflow (look for pulsus paradoxus)
MSK - rhabdo from excessive accessory muscle use, hypercapnia, steroids, neuromuscular blocking agents
Treatment:
SABA - relief from bronchospasm
oral or IV corticosteroids - decrease inflammation of airway
O2 for cyanosis, dyspnea
IV fluids for hydration
Magnesium sulfate for smooth muscle relaxation
critical care until symptoms resolve or after 24 hours, then focus on education re: meds and irritants

Mechanism of Action (MOI):
Acetaminophen: Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the brain, reducing pain and fever.
NSAIDs: Inhibit COX enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), blocking the formation of prostaglandins, reducing inflammation, pain, and fever.
Indications:
Mild to moderate pain (headache, muscle pain, arthritis)
Fever reduction
Inflammatory pain (NSAIDs)
Contraindications:
Acetaminophen: Liver disease, alcohol use, or overdose risk (liver toxicity).
NSAIDs: History of GI ulcers, kidney disease, or bleeding disorders.
Nursing Considerations:
Monitor liver function (acetaminophen) and renal function (NSAIDs).
Educate on avoiding alcohol with acetaminophen to prevent liver damage.
NSAIDs may cause GI upset, ulcers, or bleeding; recommend taking with food.
Prototype Drugs:
Morphine
Hydrocodone
Oxycodone
Fentanyl (patch, IV)
Mechanism of Action (MOI):
Bind to opioid receptors (mu, kappa) in the brain and spinal cord, blocking pain signals and altering the perception of pain.
Indications:
Severe pain (post-surgery, cancer pain, injury)
Acute pain management (short-term)
Palliative care
Contraindications:
Respiratory depression
Acute or severe asthma
Paralytic ileus or bowel obstruction
Caution in elderly, liver, or renal impairment
Nursing Considerations:

Choose the right tool or right situation!
Aldosterone (ACE/ARB)
BetaBlockers
CCBs
Digoxin
Diuretics lowers BP only (not HR) (can give for brady!)
ACE, end in “-pril” (lisinopril) = “chill pill” for the heart, (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor)
Not for pregnantMonitor for: ACE
Angioedema
Cough
E+ Imbalances (electrolytes =&gt; low Na, high K)
ARBS -sartan (losartan, telmisartan) (angiotensin receptor blockers)
“Sartan” = “relax man”. Less workload on the heart, more relaxed blood pressure
diuretic
Hold only if BP is too low
Ends in -olol (metoprolol, propranolol)Caution: 4 B’s (consistent with sympathetic inhibiting drugs)
Bradycardia &amp; heart blocks (do not give if HR&lt;60)
Bottomed out BP (hypotension)
Breathing - COPD, asthma - contraindicated
Blood sugar masking C = calms the heart (low BP, low HR) - block movement of Ca, lessening contractility
Very Nice Drugs: Verapamil, Nifedipine, Diltiazam
Do not give if:
Apical pulse &lt; 60
Below 100 SYS, MAP below 60
IV drip: big drops in BP cardiac glycoside. D for DEEP CONTRACTION.
Increase contractility, decrease HR
second line of meds for HF/AFib due to high risk of toxicity
monitor for serum digoxin &amp; K levels regularly
Do not give if:
Apical pulse &lt; 60
K &lt; 3.5 (risk for dig toxicity)
Dig toxicity (over 2.0) - vision changes, N/V, fatigue, dizzy
K Wasting - furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide
K Retaining - spironolactone

Triptans - work by constricting intracranial vessels
Ergot Alkaloids
Algorithm for treating migraine:
Mild migraine - acetaminophen or NSAID. If ineffective, move to:
Triptans Usually in oral form (may cause N/V), alternative forms are available
Intranasal or prefilled syringes also available
All triptans have similar effectiveness and side effects
If ineffective, move to: Ergot Alkaloids Ergotamine - inexpensive, available in oral, SL, suppository
Dihydroergotamine - nasal spray
Interact with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors and serotonergic receptors =&gt; many side effects.
Some E.A can cause fetal harm and should not be used by women who may become pregnant! Migraine Prophylaxis
Antiseizures - gabapentin, topiramate, valproic acid
Beta-adrenergic blockers - atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol

Esters Benzocaine, Procaine (Novocain)
Adverse: CNS depression, burning, stinging, redness Amidies Articaine, lidocaine
Adverse: burning, stinging, redness at site General Anesthetics IV Propofol (Diprivan) MOA - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist
Primary Actions Most widely used IV anesthetics due to efficacy and safety profile
indicated for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia
immediate onset of action and is used effectively for conscious sedation
Emergence is rapid and few adverse effects occur during recovery. Has an antiemetic effect that can prevent nausea and vomiting. Alerts faster onset and deeper sedation compared to benzo
not showed evidence of fetal harm
Adverse effects on breastmilk =&gt; neonate Adverse Pain, apnea, resp depression, hypOtension
collection of metabolic abnormalities and organ system failures, aka, propofol infusion syndrome (PIF)
severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, lipidemia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, and cardiac failure. Inhaled Therapeutic Gasses Nitrous Oxide Primary Actions analgesia caused by suppression of pain mechanisms in the CNS
low potency and does not produce complete loss of consciousness or profound relaxation of skeletal muscle
commonly combined with other surgical anesthetic agents. Ideal for short surgical or dental procedures because the patient remains conscious and can follow instructions while experiencing full analgesia.
always combined with oxygen (25 to 30%) and is administered in a semi closed method through a tube or by mask. Alerts Does NOT cause fetal harm
Adverse
Few adverse in low dose
At higher doses, stage 2 anesthesia such as anxiety, excitement, and combativeness
Lower dose will reverse
difficulty breathing or experience nausea and vomiting following the procedure Contra impaired consciousness, head injury, non-compliance, decompression sickness, nitrogen narcosis, air embolism, undiagnosed abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, hypotension, shock, COPD, cyanosis, pneumothorax, or air transport.
Use nitrous oxide cautiously in myasthenia gravis due to respiratory depression and prolonged effects. Monitor cardiovascular patients, especially with elevated ICP, for prolonged or potentiated hypnotic effects Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which antibodies destroy the communication between nerves and muscle, resulting in weakness of the skeletal muscles. Myasthenia gravis affects the voluntary muscles of the body, especially those that control the eyes, mouth, throat and limbs. Volatile Liquids Isoflurane (Forane) MOA - produces a potent level of surgical anesthesia that is rapid in onset
Primary Actions Provides smooth induction with a low degree of metabolism by the body
excellent muscle relaxation and may be used off-label as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of status asthmaticus
Isoflurane with oxygen or with an oxygen and nitrous oxide mixture may be used
does not sensitize the myocardium for dysrhythmias, and it produces fewer cardiovascular effects than other general anesthetics. Alerts Do not use in pregnant Adverse Mild nausea, vomiting, and tremor
dose-dependent respiratory depression and a reduction in blood pressure.
Malignant hyperthermia with elevated temperature has been reported. Contraindications Do not use for patients with genetic predisposition to malignant hyperthermia
Caution: patients with head trauma or brain neoplasms due to possible increases in intracranial pressure Adjuncts to Anesthesia
Neuromuscular Blockers
Succinylcholine (Anectine, Quelicine)
Class
Skeletal muscle paralytic drug; neuromuscular blocker
Depolarizing blocker; acetylcholine receptor blocking drug
Actions
Like acetylcholine, succinylcholine acts on cholinergic receptor sites at neuromuscular junctions
Effects are first noted as muscle weakness and muscle spasms, eventually, paralysis
rapidly broken down by the enzyme cholinesterase;
when the IV infusion is stopped, the duration of action is only a few minutes
reduces the amount of general anesthetic needed for procedures.
Alerts
Do not administer in pregnant
Adverse
can cause complete paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles
Bradycardia and respiratory depression
High doses: tachycardia, hypotension, and urinary retention.
Contra
Do not use if u have malignant hyperthermia, pulmonary, kidney, cardiovascular, metabolic, or liver dysfunction.
Extreme Caution to - patients with severe burns or trauma, neuromuscular diseases, or glaucoma]]></description><link>pharmacology/anesthetics.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pharmacology/Anesthetics.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 22:35:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Antipyretic and Anti-Inflammatory]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a href=".?query=tag:pharmacology" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#pharmacology">#pharmacology</a> <a href=".?query=tag:nursing" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#nursing">#nursing</a> Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
NSAIDS First line of drugs for mild-moderate inflammation
inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins
Ibuprofen Mechanism treatment of mild to moderate pain, fever, and inflammation.
efficacy is equivalent to that of aspirin and other NSAIDs
Due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis
indications include pain associated with chronic musculoskeletal disorders, such as RA and osteoarthritis, headache, dental pain, and dysmenorrhea. Administration Alerts Give on empty stomach
Asthma or allergies may have hypersensitivity
Caution: pregnancy. NSAID increases pregnancy risk.
DO NOT USE IN LATE PREGNANCY! (may prematurely close fetal ductus arteriosus) Adverse Effects nausea, heartburn, epigastric pain, and dizziness
Serious: GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines
may cause an increased risk of thrombotic events, MI, and stroke, which can be fatal Contraindications for the treatment of perioperative pain in those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery
CKD or hepatic impairment Corticosteroids - should only be used for 1-3 weeks, then switch to NSAID Prednisone Class - anti-inflammatory, corticosteroid
Actions and Uses allergic and inflammatory disorders
metabolized to an active form, which is also available as a drug called prednisolone
When used for inflammation, duration of therapy is commonly limited to 4 to 10 days.
For long-term therapy, alternate-day dosing is often used, and the dosage is gradually lowered.
occasionally used to terminate acute bronchospasm in patients with asthma and as an antineoplastic drug for patients with certain cancers, such as Hodgkin’s disease, acute leukemia, and lymphomas.
Available in tablet and oral solution forms. Administration Alerts Administer with food and do not chew or divide tablets.
Do not use it if signs of a systemic infection are present.
When using the drug for more than 10 days, the dose must be slowly tapered.
May cause fetal harm
Do not use if breastfeeding
Do not stop abruptly! Taper of if used longer than 1-2 weeks
Adrenal insufficiency and crisis may occur with profound hypotension, tachycardia, and other adverse effects if the drug is stopped abruptly. Adverse Effects few serious adverse effects.
Long-term therapy may result in Cushing syndrome, a condition that includes hyperglycemia, fat redistribution to the shoulders and face, muscle weakness, bruising, and bones that easily fracture.
Because gastric ulcers may occur with long-term therapy, an antiulcer medication may be prescribed prophylactically. Use with caution in patients with peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, or diverticulitis. Mood changes, increased appetite, and weight gain may occur. Contraindications: Patients with serious viral, bacterial, fungal, or protozoan infections should not take prednisone. Antipyretics
Acetaminophen Class - antipyretic, analgesic, para-aminophenol derivative
Actions and Uses Reduces fever by direct action at the level of the hypothalamus and dilation of peripheral blood vessels, which enables sweating and dissipation of heat.
has no anti-inflammatory properties; therefore, it is not effective in treating arthritis or pain caused by tissue swelling following injury.
The primary therapeutic is for the treatment of fever in children and for relief of mild to moderate pain when aspirin is contraindicated.
may be combined with opioids - for synergistic dosing
Acetaminophen has no effect on platelet aggregation and does not exhibit cardiotoxicity.
Does not cause GI bleeding or ulcers or cause Reye syndrome in children (unlike NSAIDs) Administration Alert Never administer to patients who consume alcohol regularly due to the potential for drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
extreme care must be taken to not duplicate doses by taking several products concurrently
safe for pregnant Adverse generally safe, and adverse effects are uncommon at therapeutic doses.
Excessive acetaminophen use, especially when combined with alcohol use, is the number one cause of acute liver failure in the United States.
Chronic ingestion results in neutropenia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and CKD.
Stevens–Johnson syndrome Contraindications Hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or phenacetin and chronic alcohol consumption. ]]></description><link>pharmacology/analgesia/antipyretic-and-anti-inflammatory.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Pharmacology/Analgesia/Antipyretic and Anti-Inflammatory.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 22:35:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lipid Disorders]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a href=".?query=tag:pharmacology" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#pharmacology">#pharmacology</a> <a href=".?query=tag:nursing" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#nursing">#nursing</a> Super Cholesterol Fuckers!!! - Statins, Cholestyramine, Fibrates

Tracheostomy care at HOME for caregivers clean technique is okay Tracheostomy care hydrogen peroxide for cleaning inner canula, pipe cleaners or brush to remove crusties do not use on SKIN (must be diluted if used on skin) no cotton balls
80-120mmHg suction pressure for adults, 50-100mmHg peds Catheter: Male Indwelling secure on upper thigh or lower abdomen with tape/securement device Collecting culture from wounds irrigate with NS prior to collecting
rotate swab back and forth at base of wound to collect pathogens (NOT EDGES of wound) Enema Types
Cleansing enema - removes feces stimulates peristalsis treats constipation or pre-procedure bowel prep. Retention enema - retains solution for prolonged periods for medication absorption or softening stool. Oil retention enema - softens stool lubricates rectum for easier defecation. Medicated enema - delivers drugs for local or systemic effects such as antibiotics or steroids. Carminative enema - relieves gas by stimulating peristalsis and expelling flatus. Return-flow enema - relieves gas by repeated instillation and removal of fluid to stimulate peristalsis. Hypertonic enema - draws water into the colon by osmosis for rapid evacuation. Isotonic enema - saline solution mimics body fluids to soften stool and stimulate evacuation. Soap suds enema - irritates mucosa and stimulates peristalsis using soapy water. Braden Scale: parameters are nutrition, sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, friction and shear
NG Tube Feeding - flush with 30 mL after feeding
Wound Care Hydrocolloid - best for wounds with minimal/moderate drainage, stage 2 pressure injury
Alginate - for heavy exudate, nonadherent dressings that conform to the wound’s shape and absorb exudate TPN (nutrition thru IV) - check blood glucose q4, change tubing q24, D10/D20 if nutrition unavailable, check weight daily
Oxygen At Home: do not wear cotton to limit buildup of static (ATI book says cotton is encouraged)
Vest Restraint: tie with quick release knot, allow TWO fingerbreadths between restraints and body, apply restraints over clothing
Purpose of log rolling: protect the spine

Erikson's Developmental Stages
Trust vs. Mistrust: Infancy (0-1 year) - Developing trust when caregivers provide reliability, care, and affection; lack leads to mistrust. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt: Early Childhood (1-3 years) - Building autonomy by making choices and gaining control; over-criticism can result in shame and doubt. Initiative vs. Guilt: Preschool (3-6 years) - Encouraging initiative and decision-making; overcontrol can lead to guilt. Industry vs. Inferiority: School Age (6-12 years) - Developing competence through learning and achievement; failure results in feelings of inferiority. Identity vs. Role Confusion: Adolescence (12-18 years) - Forming a strong sense of self and personal identity; failure leads to confusion about one’s role in life. Intimacy vs. Isolation: Young Adulthood (18-40 years) - Establishing meaningful, intimate relationships; failure can lead to isolation and loneliness. Generativity vs. Stagnation: Middle Adulthood (40-65 years) - Contributing to society and supporting the next generation; lack of this results in stagnation. Integrity vs. Despair: Late Adulthood (65+ years) - Reflecting on life with a sense of fulfillment and acceptance; failure leads to regret and despair.
1 lb of body = 3500 calories (having calorie excess of 500cal/day would mean 10 lbs gain within 10 weeks)Iatrogenic HAI - caused from diagnostic or therapeutic proceduresGlaucoma - optic nerve damage caused by pressure (IOP, intraocular pressure). Pressure is caused by obstructed flow of vitreous humor. Patient Movement
transferring patient from bed to wheel chair: place wheelchair 45 degree angle to bed, stand on client weaker side

preop - begins as soon as client is scheduled for surgery
intraop
postop - ends with transfer or discharge
Nurse primary role: advocateClassification of Surgical Procedures:By Purpose:
diagnostic
ablative - remove body part or tissue to destroy it (colectomy, removal of tumors)
palliative - provides relief/lessen pain
constructive - restore lost function that was present in birth
restorative/reconstructive - repair or restore a missing body part/organ
transplant
cosmetic
Seriousness:
major - risky
minor
Urgency:
emergent - ASAP, within minutes
urgent - life-saving, within hours of presentation
expedited - not emergency, within days
elective - not urgent, based on convenience
ASA Physical Class system
Class I-VI (healthy to braindead) Class I - normal healthy adult
Class II - mild medical condition
Class V - critical condition who will die w/o procedure
Class VI - brain dead, organs to be donate AORN Perioperative Patient Focused Model:
4 dimensions: Health System, Safety, Behavioral Responses and Physiological Responses.
Informed Consent:
- needs:
- procedure, potential risks, type of anesthesia, type of anesthesia, risk of anesthesia, any other potential procedures during surgery, postop plan, potential complications, risk and benefits, complications to client
- provider explains and obtains, nurse verifies and witnesses informed consent
- family member or guardian if patient is unconscious or mentally incompetentPreop Tasks:
medical surgical hx obtained, check allergies
baseline head-to-to, VS, height, weight
prep skin: avoid shaving if possible
NPO and meds
hygiene, remove all jewelry
remove nail polish to notice signs of cyanosis
don surgical gown and cap, slippers
Preop Diagnostic Tests:
CBC, Hgb, Hct
Coags: PT, INR, aPTT, platelet
Metabolic: electrolyte, ck, BUN
HCG, urinalysis
CXR, ECG
Bloodtype &amp; screen: if possibility of heavy bleeding (hip replacement) phase start/end: operating table to PACU/ICU
Nurse role: circulating/scrub know type of surgery &amp; anesthesia
assist, client positioning
maintain aseptic environment, document, monitor complications phase start/end: PACU until recovery from procedure
pain assessment- begins in preop stage to establish baseline pain
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
surgical protocol implemented to drive client-centered process postoperatively to improve client outcomes
must involve whole team
focuses: mobility, nutrition, pain, manage N/V, discontinue IV fluids ASAP, continue client education begins in preop stage
teach specific equipment, medications, recovery exercises (breathing, coughing, spirometer, leg exercises, position changes), pain management, coping techniques, etc.
Diaphragm Breathing Exercise
lie supine, hands on stomach, inhale nose, exhale pursed lips, repeat 5 times
Deep Breathing Exercise
sit back, inhale 4 seconds nose, hold breath for 8 seconds, exhale 8 seconds pursed lips, repeat 3 times
Incentive Spirometer
sit, set goal marker, breath in, once goal reached, hold for as long as possible
exhale slowly, pause then repeat 10 times
done every hour for 10 times
Postop Education Topics:
proper nutrition
meds
lifestyle
wound care
follow-up Malignant Hyperthermia - genetic disorder triggered by anesthesia/succinylcholines, life-threatening treatment: dantrolene
tachycardia, tachypnea, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperkalemia, hypercarbia, and muscular rigidity. Note: postop clients are at increased risk of: delayed wound healing
infection
increased length of stay
aspiration
DVT Note: OSA = higher risk of difficult intubation
Note: PACU priority: maintain airway and respiratory status
Note: cardiac postop = increased risk for hypothermia
Dehiscence Treatment: cover with sterile dressing soaked in saline and then notify provider prevention: limit vomiting, coughing, constipation Aldrete Score - scoring system determines if patient can be safely discharged from PACU must be 8-10 for discharge
criteria: oxygenation, RR, circulation, LOC, activity similar to periop nursing
nurse provides support, care, fluids, and blood if ordered and monitors the client closely for organ rejection
Note precautions: immunocompromised from the medications and procedures
Note: critical time in first 24 hours after transplant
main complication: rejection of organ
Types of Organ Rejection:
Hyperacute rejection - minutes or hours after transplantation, caused by antibodies
Acute rejection - caused by certain lymphocytes that detect antigens in the transplanted tissue or organ days or weeks after transplantation
Chronic rejection - months or years following organ or tissue transplantation.
