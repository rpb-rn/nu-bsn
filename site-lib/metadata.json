LOC Questions\nSay: “What month is it?” “How old are you?” Score: 1 point for each incorrect or no answer. 1c. LOC Commands\nSay: “Open and close your eyes.” Then “Grip and release my hand.” Look For: Correct performance of both tasks. 2. Best Gaze\nHow: Ask them to follow your finger horizontally (not vertical). Look For: Symmetric movement of both eyes; forced deviation or inability to track. 3. Visual Fields\nHow: Cover one eye at a time. Wiggle fingers in upper/lower quadrants. Ask: “How many fingers do you see?” or “Point to the side where you see movement.” Look For: Field cuts or blindness. 4. Facial Palsy\nSay: “Show me your teeth.” “Close your eyes tight.” “Raise your eyebrows.” Look For: Symmetry, droop, weakness. 5. Motor Arm (Left &amp; Right)\nHow: Hold arm up 90° (sitting) or 45° (lying). Say: “Keep your arm up — don’t let it drift.” Watch: For 10 seconds. Look For: Drift, falling, or no movement. 6. Motor Leg (Left &amp; Right)\nHow: Hold leg up 30° while lying down. Say: “Keep your leg up — don’t let it fall.” Watch: For 5 seconds. Look For: Drift, effort, or no movement 7. Limb Ataxia\nHow: Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests (eyes open). Look For: Overshooting, jerky or uncoordinated movement. Note: Score only if weakness isn’t the cause. 8. Sensory\nHow: Lightly touch arms/legs with your fingers or a pin. Ask: “Does this feel the same on both sides?” Look For: Numbness, decreased feeling, no response. 9. Best Language\nHow: Show picture cards, name objects, repeat phrases, describe a scene. Look For: Word-finding difficulty, gibberish, comprehension issues. 10.

Initiative vs. Guilt: Preschool (3-6 years) - Encouraging initiative and decision-making; overcontrol can lead to guilt. Industry vs. Inferiority: School Age (6-12 years) - Developing competence through learning and achievement; failure results in feelings of inferiority. Identity vs. Role Confusion: Adolescence (12-18 years) - Forming a strong sense of self and personal identity; failure leads to confusion about one’s role in life. Intimacy vs. Isolation: Young Adulthood (18-40 years) - Establishing meaningful, intimate relationships; failure can lead to isolation and loneliness. Generativity vs. Stagnation: Middle Adulthood (40-65 years) - Contributing to society and supporting the next generation; lack of this results in stagnation. Integrity vs. Despair: Late Adulthood (65+ years) - Reflecting on life with a sense of fulfillment and acceptance; failure leads to regret and despair.\n1 lb of body = 3500 calories (having calorie excess of 500cal/day would mean 10 lbs gain within 10 weeks)Iatrogenic HAI - caused from diagnostic or therapeutic proceduresGlaucoma - optic nerve damage caused by pressure (IOP, intraocular pressure).

Disease","icon":"","description":"\nA vasospastic disorder that causes intermittent constriction of small arteries, usually in fingers and toes. Triggered by cold exposure or stress, leading to reduced blood flow and color changes. Primary Raynaud’s: Idiopathic with no underlying disease. Secondary Raynaud’s: Associated with autoimmune conditions (e.g., <a data-href=\"Scleroderma\" href=\"med-surg/immunity-&amp;-inflammation/scleroderma.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Scleroderma</a>, <a data-href=\"Lupus\" href=\"med-surg/immunity-&amp;-inflammation/lupus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lupus</a>, <a data-href=\"Rheumatoid Arthritis\" href=\"med-surg/immunity-&amp;-inflammation/rheumatoid-arthritis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rheumatoid Arthritis</a>). Female sex (more common in women ages 15–40). Cold environments. Family history of Raynaud’s or autoimmune disease. Occupational triggers (e.g., vibration tools). Smoking (vasoconstriction). Triphasic color changes in digits: White (pallor) from vasoconstriction. Blue (cyanosis) from poor oxygenation. Red (rubor) from reperfusion. Numbness, tingling, burning pain during or after attacks. Cold, pale, or blue fingers/toes, often symmetrical. Ulcers or sores on fingers in severe cases. Tissue necrosis if blood flow is severely compromised. Functional impairment with frequent attacks. Clinical history and symptoms during cold/stress exposure. Nailfold capillaroscopy to examine capillary structure (esp. in secondary). Antibody testing (ANA, anti-centromere) for autoimmune association. Lifestyle modifications: Avoid cold, wear gloves, keep core warm. Manage stress. Stop smoking. Medications: Calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine) – relax vessels. Vasodilators (e.g., topical nitroglycerin). In secondary cases, treat underlying condition. Severe cases: Sympathectomy (nerve surgery to reduce spasms). Teach cold avoidance strategies and layering clothing. Encourage smoking cessation. Educate on early symptom recognition and attack prevention. Monitor for skin breakdown or signs of ulceration/ischemia. In secondary Raynaud’s, coordinate care for underlying autoimmune disease.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Causes","level":2,"id":"Causes_0"},{"heading":"Risk Factors","level":2,"id":"Risk_Factors_0"},{"heading":"Clinical Manifestations","level":2,"id":"Clinical_Manifestations_0"},{"heading":"Complications","level":2,"id":"Complications_0"},{"heading":"Diagnosis","level":2,"id":"Diagnosis_0"},{"heading":"Treatment","level":2,"id":"Treatment_0"},{"heading":"Nursing Considerations","level":2,"id":"Nursing_Considerations_0"}],"links":["med-surg/immunity-&-inflammation/scleroderma.html","med-surg/immunity-&-inflammation/lupus.html","med-surg/immunity-&-inflammation/rheumatoid-arthritis.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"med-surg/cardiovascular/vascular/raynaud’s-disease.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1743980500000,"modifiedTime":1743980500000,"sourceSize":2200,"sourcePath":"Med-Surg/Cardiovascular/Vascular/Raynaud’s Disease.md","exportPath":"med-surg/cardiovascular/vascular/raynaud’s-disease.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":38,"backlinks":["med-surg/immunity-&-inflammation/scleroderma.html"],"type":"markdown"},"med-surg/cardiovascular/vascular/raynaud's-vs-buerger's-disease.html":{"title":"Raynaud's vs Buerger's Disease","icon":"","description":"\nRaynaud’s = Red, White, Blue (triphasic response) Buerger’s = Bad smoker’s fingers ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"🔑 Mnemonics","level":3,"id":"🔑_Mnemonics_0"},{"heading":"Raynaud’s vs Buerger’s Disease – Quick Comparison","level":3,"id":"Raynaud’s_vs_Buerger’s_Disease_–_Quick_Comparison_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"med-surg/cardiovascular/vascular/raynaud's-vs-buerger's-disease.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1745024372000,"modifiedTime":1745024372000,"sourceSize":1479,"sourcePath":"Med-Surg/Cardiovascular/Vascular/Raynaud's vs Buerger's Disease.md","exportPath":"med-surg/cardiovascular/vascular/raynaud's-vs-buerger's-disease.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":39,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"med-surg/cardiovascular/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm.html":{"title":"Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm","icon":"","description":"\ndilation of the aorta greater than 30mm\nif greater than 55mm =&gt;

Elevate the casted limb above heart level for the first 24–48 hours to reduce swelling. Turn the patient every 2 hours if in a body cast to prevent skin breakdown. Keep the cast dry if it’s not waterproof — cover with plastic when bathing. Use the palm of your hands (not fingers) to handle a wet plaster cast to prevent indentations. Report signs of complications: numbness, tingling, severe pain, swelling, foul odor, drainage, or cool/pale skin. Encourage movement of fingers/toes distal to the cast to maintain circulation. Apply ice packs to the cast over a towel for the first 24–48 hrs to reduce swelling (if approved). Don’t insert objects (like pens or coat hangers) into the cast to relieve itching — risk of injury and infection. Don't insert cotton wipe to dry inside cast - use blow dryer on COOL setting instead\nDon’t get the cast wet, unless it's made of water-resistant material. Don’t cover a wet cast with plastic — it traps heat and moisture and may cause skin damage. Don’t ignore foul smells or drainage — these could be signs of infection or pressure ulcers under the cast. Don’t bear weight on the cast unless it’s a walking cast and the doctor says it’s okay. Don’t trim or pull apart edges of the cast — always consult a provider if the cast is uncomfortable or damaged.

Treatment Approach: Can include symptom management alongside or instead of curative treatments. Client Support: Helps clients understand treatment options and make informed choices. Interprofessional Team: Includes nurses, social workers, dietitians, chaplains, and providers; tailored to client needs. Goals: Supports clients in living actively until death, focusing on comfort and symptom control. Common Symptoms Managed: Dyspnea and pain are primary concerns. Early Implementation Benefits: More effective when started early, reducing unnecessary hospitalizations.\nPalliative Sedation Used for terminally ill or actively dying clients with distressing symptoms Relieves pain, agitation, and anxiety to prevent unnecessary suffering Not intended to hasten death Common medications: opiates, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics Risks: respiratory depression, aspiration, delirium-related agitation Requires informed consent from the client or legal proxy Must align with advanced directives if applicable Definition: Focuses on comfort, quality of life, and support for clients nearing the end of life.\nEligibility: For clients with a terminal illness, typically with a prognosis of fewer than six months, though it can be extended.\nCare Approach: Provides comfort care rather than curative treatment.\nSettings: Can be provided at home, in hospitals, hospice centers, or nursing homes.\nInterprofessional Team: Offers medical, emotional, physical, spiritual, and social support.\nHome Hospice: Primarily managed by family and friends with hospice team support.\nRespite Care: Temporary relief for caregivers to prevent burnout.\nNursing Role: Collaborates with clients, families, and the care team to honor patient wishes and provide education.\nPalliative vs. Hospice Care Comparison\nPalliative Care: Provided alongside curative treatments or as symptom management\nCan begin at any stage of a serious illness\nAims to improve quality of life and relieve symptoms\nAvailable in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes Hospice Care: For clients with a terminal illness, typically with a prognosis of ≤6 months\nFocuses on comfort rather than curative treatment\nProvided at home, in hospice centers, hospitals, or nursing homes\nPrimarily managed by family with hospice team support Both: Aim to improve quality of life\nUse an interprofessional team for medical, emotional, social, and spiritual support\nManage symptoms such as pain and dyspnea\nRespect client autonomy and end-of-life wishes Identifying Potential Donors: Clients must meet brain death criteria (irreversible loss of all brain function).\nBrain death is confirmed through apnea, known-cause coma, and absent brainstem reflexes.\nClients near death (not brain dead) may still be assessed for potential donation. Organs &amp; Tissues Eligible for Donation: Organs: Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, pancreas, intestines.\nTissues: Corneas, middle ear, heart valves, bone, veins, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, skin.\nOther Donations: Hands, face, bone marrow, cord blood, blood stem cells, blood, platelets.\nLive Organ Donation: One kidney, one lung, part of the liver, pancreas, or intestine. Assessment &amp; Scoring: CGS: Score of 3 with the absence of at least three brainstem reflexes indicates imminent brain death.\nFOUR Score: Evaluates respiration, eye response, brainstem response, and motor response (score of 0 suggests brain death). Nurse’s Role in Brain Death &amp; Donation Process: Assess and document brainstem reflexes and neurological status.\nMaintain circulation and respiratory function with mechanical ventilation and vasopressors.\nWork closely with the organ donation coordinator to evaluate donor suitability.\nShift care focus from treatment of the client to organ preservation. Priorities in Donor Care: Maintain a patent airway and normal body temperature.\nEnsure adequate oxygenation and perfusion of organs.\nMaintain fluid and electrolyte balance to prevent complications. Family Communication &amp; Support: Nurses play a key role in discussing organ donation due to their relationship with the family.\nUse clear, compassionate communication, explaining brain death and prognosis.\nRespect cultural and spiritual beliefs regarding death and organ donation.\nFamilies are more likely to consent when they experience compassion, commitment, and clear information. Education &amp; Training for Nurses: Ongoing training on organ donation, brain death criteria, grief counseling, and facility protocols.\nSensitivity to the death and dying process is crucial. Pain &amp; Symptom Management: Assess and manage pain, dyspnea, agitation, and secretions using medications (opioids, benzodiazepines, anticholinergics).\nComfort Care: Reposition frequently, provide skin care, and use moisture barriers to prevent breakdown. Keep the client clean, dry, and comfortable.\nRespiratory Support: Elevate the head of the bed, use oxygen if needed for comfort, and provide suctioning or anticholinergic medications for excessive secretions.\nEmotional &amp; Psychological Support: Offer reassurance, provide presence, and support the client and family emotionally. Encourage open discussions about end-of-life wishes.\nCommunication: Speak softly, use simple phrases, and ensure the client and family understand changes occurring. Provide honest but compassionate information.\nHydration &amp; Nutrition: Do not force food or fluids; provide oral care to prevent dryness and cracking of lips.

Vessels: Umbilical Vein (1): Carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus.\nUmbilical Arteries (2): Carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus back to the placenta. Blood Flow Path: Oxygenated blood from placenta Umbilical vein Ductus venosus Inferior vena cava Right atrium Foramen ovale Left atrium Left ventricle Aorta (to head/upper body) / Some from right atrium Right ventricle Pulmonary artery Ductus arteriosus Aorta (to lower body) / Small amount to lungs Hypogastric (internal iliac) arteries Umbilical arteries Placenta. Underlying Issues: Conditions that compromise uteroplacental function or fetal cardiovascular development.\nExamples of Risk Factors/Conditions: Placental Insufficiency: Reduced blood flow or damage to the placenta (e.g., preeclampsia, chronic abruption, maternal hypertension/diabetes) leading to inadequate oxygen/nutrient exchange.\nIntrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR): Often a consequence of compromised placental function, leading to adaptive fetal circulatory changes (e.g., brain-sparing effect where blood is preferentially shunted to the brain).\nCongenital Heart Defects (CHDs): Structural abnormalities of the heart or great vessels that alter normal fetal shunting patterns and blood flow, potentially leading to cardiac strain or inadequate oxygenation (e.g., hypoplastic left heart syndrome, transposition of the great arteries).\nFetal Anemia: Reduces oxygen-carrying capacity, forcing the fetal heart to work harder.\nFetal Infection: Some infections (e.g., TORCH) can directly damage the fetal heart or vasculature, impacting circulation.\nPersistent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) / Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) after birth: Failure of these fetal shunts to close post-natally leads to abnormal shunting, increased pulmonary blood flow (PDA), or deoxygenated blood entering systemic circulation (PFO with right-to-left shunt).\nPulmonary Hypertension (PPHN): Failure of pulmonary vascular resistance to decrease at birth, leading to persistent shunting away from the lungs (via PFO and PDA), resulting in hypoxemia. Manifestations of Compromise: Abnormal Doppler flow studies (e.g., absent/reversed end-diastolic flow in umbilical artery).\nFetal bradycardia or tachycardia (indicating distress).\nHydrops fetalis (fluid accumulation in fetal compartments).\nAltered fetal growth.\nAbnormal shunting patterns observed on fetal echocardiogram.

Trauma: Operative vaginal delivery (forceps, vacuum), precipitous delivery, large infant.\nTissue: Placenta previa, accreta, increta, percreta.\nThrombin: Pre-existing bleeding disorders, severe preeclampsia, placental abruption, sepsis. Early signs: Excessive vaginal bleeding (saturating pads quickly, steady trickle), boggy uterus (not firm).\nLate signs (Hypovolemic Shock): Hypotension, tachycardia, pallor, dizziness, oliguria, altered mental status.\nNCLEX Tip: Don't wait for signs of shock; recognize and act on early signs of excessive bleeding! Hypovolemic shock.\nAnemia.\nAcute kidney injury.\nSheehan's Syndrome (postpartum pituitary necrosis due to severe blood loss).\nPeripartum hysterectomy.\nMaternal death.

Assess Fundus: Immediately after birth and frequently. Should be firm, midline, at or below umbilicus. If boggy, massage until firm.\nAssess Lochia: Quantity, color, presence of clots. Quantify blood loss accurately.\nVital Signs: Monitor every 5-15 minutes in acute hemorrhage. Recognize subtle changes.\nBladder: Ensure bladder is empty (full bladder can displace uterus and prevent contraction). Straight catheterize if needed.\nIV Access: Ensure at least two large-bore (18-gauge) IVs for fluid and blood product administration.\nMedication Administration: Understand mechanism of action, dosages, routes, and contraindications of uterotonics.\nEmotional Support: Keep patient and family informed. Maintain a calm environment.\nTeam Communication: Alert provider immediately for signs of PPH. Initiate rapid response if indicated.\nPost-PPH Care: Monitor for anemia, fatigue.

Intensity and duration depend on TSB level, age, and risk factors.\nMay involve single, double, or triple phototherapy. Exchange Transfusion: Used for extremely high TSB levels, rapid rise despite phototherapy, or signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy. Involves removing small amounts of infant's blood and replacing with donor blood to quickly lower bilirubin and remove antibodies.\nIntravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG): May be used in immune-mediated hemolytic jaundice (e.g., ABO/Rh incompatibility) to reduce antibody-mediated hemolysis and decrease need for exchange transfusion.\nTreat underlying cause: Antibiotics for sepsis.\nSurgery for biliary atresia.\nSpecific treatments for metabolic disorders.

Fragile Germinal Matrix Vessels: Premature infants have delicate, immature blood vessels in the germinal matrix that are prone to rupture.\nFluctuations in Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF): Premature infants have impaired cerebral autoregulation (ability to maintain stable CBF despite changes in systemic blood pressure). Sudden increases or decreases in systemic blood pressure can lead to rupture of fragile vessels.\nHypoxia-Ischemia: Lack of oxygen or blood flow to the brain can damage vessels.\nReperfusion Injury: After an ischemic event, restoration of blood flow can cause vessel damage and bleeding. Prematurity: Gestational age weeks (especially extremely low birth weight infants, ).\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS): Requires mechanical ventilation, which can cause fluctuations in blood pressure and CBF.\nMechanical Ventilation: Especially if unstable (e.g., rapid changes in ventilatory settings).\nPerinatal Asphyxia/Hypoxia.\nRapid changes in blood pressure: Hypotension followed by rapid fluid resuscitation or use of vasopressors.\nAcidosis.\nPneumothorax.\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA).\nSepsis/Infection.\nCoagulopathy/Bleeding disorders.\nRapid volume expansion.\nUmbilical cord clamping delays.\nTraumatic delivery.\nMaternal factors: Chorioamnionitis, maternal hypertension (some studies).\nNCLEX Tip: The more premature the infant, the higher the risk of PIVH. Often asymptomatic, especially Grade I/II, detected by screening ultrasound.\nAcute Deterioration (more common in Grade III/IV, \"saltatory\" course): Apnea and bradycardia (sudden onset).\nPallor.\nCyanosis.\nPoor muscle tone (hypotonia).\nWeak cry, lethargy.\nBulging or tense fontanelle (indicates increased intracranial pressure).\nSeizures (focal or generalized).\nDecreased reflexes.\nMetabolic acidosis.\nDrop in hematocrit. NCLEX Tip: Be alert for sudden, unexplained changes in a preterm infant's neurological status, breathing pattern, or vital signs. Hydrocephalus (Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus): Most common complication, especially with Grade III/IV, due to obstruction of CSF flow by blood clots. Requires ventricular taps or shunt placement.\nPeriventricular Leukomalacia (PVL): Damage to the white matter, often due to ischemia or infarction near the hemorrhage, leading to motor deficits.\nCerebral Palsy (CP): Especially spastic diplegia (affecting legs more), related to white matter injury.\nNeurodevelopmental Impairment: Cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, behavioral problems.\nSeizure disorder.\nVision and hearing impairment.\nDeath: More common with severe (Grade III/IV) hemorrhage. Cranial Ultrasound (CUS): Primary diagnostic tool. Non-invasive, bedside, highly effective. Recommended for all infants weeks gestation: At 7-14 days of life (when most bleeds manifest).\nRepeat at 4-6 weeks corrected age, or if clinical signs suggest deterioration.\nEarlier screening within the first 72 hours for high-risk infants. MRI: May be used for more detailed evaluation, especially in later follow-up or if CUS is inconclusive. No specific treatment to stop the bleeding once it occurs.\nSupportive Care (primary focus is prevention and minimizing secondary injury): Stabilize blood pressure: Avoid wide fluctuations (both hypotension and hypertension).\nRespiratory support: Optimize ventilation, minimize hypercapnia or hypocapnia.\nMaintain normal acid-base balance.\nMinimize handling/stress: Cluster care, gentle movements.\nHead in midline position: Avoid neck hyperextension/flexion.\nStrict fluid and electrolyte management.\nCorrect coagulopathies. Management of Hydrocephalus (if develops): Serial lumbar punctures/ventricular taps: To remove CSF and reduce pressure.\nVentricular reservoir placement: Temporary measure to drain CSF.\nVentricular-peritoneal (VP) shunt: Surgical insertion of a permanent drain from brain to abdomen for CSF drainage. Neuroprotection (Prevention): Antenatal Corticosteroids: Administered to mothers at risk of preterm birth (reduces incidence and severity of PIVH).\nDelayed cord clamping: May help stabilize CBF.\nAvoidance of rapid intravenous fluid boluses.\nIndomethacin (for PDA): May reduce PIVH risk, but controversial. Prevention: Adhere strictly to prevention protocols for preterm infants (e.g., gentle handling, neutral head position, minimal stimulation, careful fluid management).\nNeurological Assessment: Frequent and thorough neurological assessments, looking for subtle changes in tone, activity, reflexes, fontanelle, and cry.\nVital Sign Stability: Meticulous monitoring of HR, BP, RR, SpO2. Report significant fluctuations promptly.\nRespiratory Support: Ensure optimal ventilatory settings, minimize suctioning trauma.\nFluid Management: Accurately measure intake and output. Administer fluids and medications precisely.\nHead Circumference: Measure daily and plot on a growth chart to detect rapid increases indicative of hydrocephalus.\nClustering Care: Organize care activities to minimize disturbances and allow for longer periods of uninterrupted rest.\nPain Management: Assess for and manage pain/discomfort appropriately.\nParental Support: Provide clear, compassionate communication about the infant's condition, prognosis, and potential long-term outcomes. Encourage bonding and involvement in care.\nNCLEX Tip: Any sudden change in neurological status, feeding, or vital signs in a preterm infant should raise immediate suspicion for PIVH or its complications. Explanation of PIVH: Explain what the bleed is, why it happened (fragile vessels, prematurity), and its potential implications using clear, simple language.\nGrading System: Explain the Papile grading (I-IV) and what each grade signifies in terms of severity and potential outcome.\nPrognosis: Be honest but hopeful. For Grade I/II, explain good prognosis. For Grade III/IV, discuss potential for hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and developmental delays, emphasizing that outcomes vary.\nMonitoring: Explain the need for frequent ultrasounds and other tests.\nSigns of Complications: Educate parents on signs of increasing head circumference, bulging fontanelle, vomiting, irritability, lethargy, or seizures, and when to seek immediate medical attention.\nLong-term Follow-up: Stress the importance of developmental follow-up programs (e.g., NICU follow-up clinic, early intervention services) to monitor and support neurodevelopment.\nHome Care: If discharged with a shunt, provide detailed instructions on shunt care and signs of malfunction or infection.\nSupport Resources: Provide information on support groups or resources for parents of preterm infants or children with special needs.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Causes","level":2,"id":"Causes_0"},{"heading":"Risk Factors","level":2,"id":"Risk_Factors_0"},{"heading":"Manifestations","level":2,"id":"Manifestations_0"},{"heading":"Complications","level":2,"id":"Complications_0"},{"heading":"Diagnostic","level":2,"id":"Diagnostic_0"},{"heading":"Treatment","level":2,"id":"Treatment_0"},{"heading":"Nursing Considerations","level":2,"id":"Nursing_Considerations_0"},{"heading":"Patient Education","level":2,"id":"Patient_Education_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"ob/v.-newborn/complications/periventricular-intraventricular-hemorrhage-(pivh).html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750804211000,"modifiedTime":1750804211000,"sourceSize":8241,"sourcePath":"OB/v.

If PaO2 remains low, suggests shunting (PPHN or cyanotic heart disease).\nPre- and Post-Ductal Pulse Oximetry: Significant difference () suggests right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus.\nEchocardiogram (Cardiac Ultrasound): Definitive diagnosis. Visualizes heart structure, assesses pulmonary artery pressure, identifies shunting (ductus arteriosus, foramen ovale), and assesses right ventricular function.\nChest X-ray: May show underlying lung disease (e.g., MAS, pneumonia) but often appears normal in primary PPHN.\nArterial Blood Gas (ABG): Shows hypoxemia, often with respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Goal: Reduce PVR, improve oxygenation, support systemic blood pressure.\nSupportive Care: Optimal Thermoregulation: Maintain neutral thermal environment.\nMinimize Stimulation/Handling: Cluster care, sedation to reduce agitation and oxygen consumption.\nFluid and Electrolyte Balance: Strict monitoring.\nNutrition: IV fluids or gavage feedings. Oxygen Therapy: Maintain adequate oxygenation.\nMechanical Ventilation: Often required, carefully managed to avoid lung injury, optimize lung volume, and minimize PVR.\nPharmacological Agents: Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO): First-line specific pulmonary vasodilator. Selectively relaxes pulmonary blood vessels without affecting systemic blood pressure.\nSildenafil (Viagra/Revatio): Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, used orally or IV to relax pulmonary vessels.\nMilrinone: Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, improves cardiac contractility and causes pulmonary vasodilation.\nProstaglandins (e.g., Iloprost): Pulmonary vasodilators.\nVasopressors/Inotropes: (e.g., Dopamine, Dobutamine) to maintain systemic blood pressure and cardiac output, ensuring adequate perfusion and preventing shunting. Surfactant Therapy: If underlying RDS or MAS with surfactant deficiency.\nExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO): Cardiopulmonary bypass used for severe, refractory PPHN when maximal conventional therapy fails. Continuous Monitoring: Intensive care setting. Continuous monitoring of HR, BP, RR, SpO2 (pre- and post-ductal). Arterial line for continuous BP and ABG sampling.\nRespiratory Management: Meticulous ventilator management. Avoid sudden changes in settings. Frequent assessment for air leaks (pneumothorax).\nFluid and Electrolyte Balance: Strict I&amp;O, monitor electrolytes, acid-base status.\nMedication Administration: Administer iNO (requires special equipment/monitoring), vasodilators, inotropes, and sedatives precisely. Monitor for desired effects and adverse reactions (e.g., hypotension with vasodilators).\nMinimize Stimulation: Create a quiet, dark environment. Cluster care, handle gently, avoid unnecessary procedures. Sedation often used.\nThermoregulation: Maintain normothermia to minimize oxygen consumption.\nNeuroprotection: Monitor for signs of HIE.\nParental Support: This is a critical illness. Provide consistent updates, answer questions honestly, facilitate bonding, and offer emotional support and resources.\nNCLEX Tip: Prioritize oxygenation and ventilation, followed by maintaining systemic blood pressure and reducing pulmonary vascular resistance. Recognize signs of deterioration quickly. Explanation of PPHN: Explain the condition simply – that the blood vessels in the lungs are too tight, making it hard for the baby to get enough oxygen.\nCauses and Risk Factors: Discuss why their baby might have developed PPHN (e.g., MAS, premature birth, C-section).\nTreatment Plan: Detail the various treatments (oxygen, ventilation, iNO, other medications), explaining their purpose and what to expect (e.g., baby will be on a breathing machine, may need special IVs).\nCritical Care: Explain the need for intensive monitoring and the equipment in the NICU.\nPrognosis and Complications: Be honest about the severity of the condition, potential for long-term complications (brain injury, hearing loss, developmental delays), but also offer hope and emphasize the importance of early intervention and follow-up.\nParental Role: Explain how parents can help (e.g., minimizing stimulation, talking gently, touch).\nLong-term Follow-up: Stress the importance of developmental follow-up clinics, early intervention services, and hearing screenings for neurodevelopmental monitoring.\nNCLEX Tip: Reassure parents that PPHN is not their fault and provide them with clear, consistent information to reduce anxiety.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Causes","level":2,"id":"Causes_0"},{"heading":"Risk Factors","level":2,"id":"Risk_Factors_0"},{"heading":"Manifestations","level":2,"id":"Manifestations_0"},{"heading":"Complications","level":2,"id":"Complications_0"},{"heading":"Diagnostic","level":2,"id":"Diagnostic_0"},{"heading":"Treatment","level":2,"id":"Treatment_0"},{"heading":"Nursing Considerations","level":2,"id":"Nursing_Considerations_0"},{"heading":"Patient Education","level":2,"id":"Patient_Education_0"}],"links":["ob/v.-newborn/complications/meconium-aspiration-syndrome.html","ob/v.-newborn/complications/respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-newborn.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"ob/v.-newborn/complications/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn-(pphn).html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750813664000,"modifiedTime":1750813664000,"sourceSize":8078,"sourcePath":"OB/v.

Prematurity (even late preterm, 34-36 weeks).\nEast Asian ethnicity.\nFamily history of physiologic jaundice.\nMaternal diabetes.\nMale gender.\nPolycythemia.\nHistory of cephalohematoma or significant bruising. Yellowing of skin and sclera: Typically visible when total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels reach .\nAppears after 24 hours of life.\nProgression is usually cephalocaudal (starts on face, progresses to trunk and extremities).\nJaundice typically resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks in term infants.\nInfant usually appears otherwise healthy, feeding well, and active.\nNCLEX Tip: Differentiating between physiologic and pathologic jaundice is crucial. Remember: physiologic jaundice never appears in the first 24 hours of life. Generally no complications as it's a benign process.\nUntreated severe hyperbilirubinemia (even if initially physiologic) can become pathologic and lead to: Acute bilirubin encephalopathy.\nKernicterus (chronic bilirubin encephalopathy) - permanent neurological damage. This happens when bilirubin levels are excessively high and toxic to the brain. Clinical assessment: Visual inspection (blanch skin to check for yellowing), typically done every 8-12 hours in the first few days.\nTranscutaneous Bilirubin (TcB) measurement: Non-invasive device used for screening. If TcB is high, a TSB (Total Serum Bilirubin) blood test is performed.\nTotal Serum Bilirubin (TSB) measurement: Blood test is the gold standard. Levels are plotted on a nomogram based on the infant's age in hours to assess risk for hyperbilirubinemia. Assessment of feeding and hydration.\nRule out pathologic causes: If jaundice is severe, early onset, or persists, further investigation is needed (e.g., direct Coombs test, blood type, CBC, direct bilirubin). No specific treatment often required: Many infants with physiologic jaundice do not need intervention beyond monitoring.\nFrequent and effective feedings: Breastfed infants: Nurse times in 24 hours to promote bilirubin excretion through stools and ensure adequate hydration. Avoid water or dextrose water supplementation.\nFormula-fed infants: Ensure adequate intake. Phototherapy: If TSB levels cross specific thresholds on the nomogram for the infant's age and risk factors. Blue-green light converts unconjugated bilirubin into water-soluble isomers for excretion. Discontinuation of breastfeeding (temporarily): Rarely indicated for breast milk jaundice if bilirubin levels are dangerously high and other measures fail. Mother can pump to maintain supply. Assessment: Visual assessment for jaundice: Check skin color (blanching on forehead/nose), sclera. Note progression.\nFeeding assessment: Observe latch, suck, swallow, and number of wet diapers/stools. Promote effective feeding.\nHydration status: Assess fontanelles, skin turgor, mucous membranes.\nVital signs: Especially temperature (phototherapy can cause hyperthermia). Monitoring: Bilirubin levels: Track TcB/TSB results and plot on nomogram.\nWeight: Monitor for excessive weight loss.\nOutput: Document number of wet diapers and stools. Patient Education: Explain physiologic jaundice as a normal process.\nTeach parents how to assess for jaundice and when to seek medical attention.\nEmphasize the importance of frequent feedings and adequate hydration. Phototherapy Care (if needed): Maximize skin exposure (diaper only).\nApply eye patches.\nMonitor temperature closely.\nEnsure adequate fluid intake.\nPromote parent-infant bonding during breaks. NCLEX Tip: Focus on education and supportive measures. Early and effective feeding is key in preventing severe physiologic jaundice. Normal vs. concerning jaundice: Explain that mild yellowing after 24 hours is common and usually resolves, but explain signs that warrant concern.\nMonitoring at home: Teach parents how to check for jaundice (blanching skin) and how far it has progressed.\nFeeding is key: Emphasize the importance of frequent (8-12 times/day) and effective feedings to help baby pass bilirubin in stools.\nWarning signs to call the provider: Jaundice appears within the first 24 hours of life.\nJaundice spreads rapidly or appears very deep yellow/orange.\nBaby is difficult to wake, not feeding well, excessively sleepy, irritable, has a high-pitched cry.\nFewer wet diapers or stools than expected.\nFever. No home remedies: Advise against using using sunlight or other unproven methods for treating jaundice, as they are ineffective and potentially harmful.\nFollow-up: Stress the importance of all scheduled bilirubin checks and well-baby visits.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Causes","level":2,"id":"Causes_0"},{"heading":"Risk Factors","level":2,"id":"Risk_Factors_0"},{"heading":"Manifestations","level":2,"id":"Manifestations_0"},{"heading":"Complications","level":2,"id":"Complications_0"},{"heading":"Diagnostic","level":2,"id":"Diagnostic_0"},{"heading":"Treatment","level":2,"id":"Treatment_0"},{"heading":"Nursing Considerations","level":2,"id":"Nursing_Considerations_0"},{"heading":"Patient Education","level":2,"id":"Patient_Education_0"}],"links":["ob/v.-newborn/complications/pathologic-jaundice-in-newborns.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"ob/v.-newborn/complications/physiological-jaundice-of-the-newborn.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750803297000,"modifiedTime":1750803297000,"sourceSize":6616,"sourcePath":"OB/v.

Cyanotic heart disease (right-to-left shunting) Unknown in most cases\nGenetic and environmental factors implicated Pulmonary Stenosis: Narrowing of the pulmonary valve or artery, obstructing blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs. Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD): Hole between the right and left ventricles, allowing blood to shunt. Overriding Aorta: Aorta is displaced to the right, sitting directly over the VSD, receiving blood from both ventricles. Right Ventricular Hypertrophy: Right ventricle muscle thickens from increased workload due to pulmonary stenosis and pumping against systemic pressure via the VSD. Shunting: Degree of pulmonary stenosis dictates direction of shunt and severity of symptoms. Mild Stenosis: May be left-to-right shunt (acyanotic) initially. Severe Stenosis: Increased right ventricular pressure forces deoxygenated blood through the VSD into the left ventricle and overriding aorta (right-to-left shunt) = cyanosis. Tet Spells: Acute increase in right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (spasm), leading to a sudden, dramatic increase in right-to-left shunting and severe cyanosis. Maternal rubella or other viral illnesses during pregnancy\nPoor maternal nutrition\nMaternal alcohol consumption\nMaternal age over 40\nDiabetes in the mother\nGenetic disorders (e.g., Down syndrome) Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of skin, lips, nail beds), especially with crying or feeding\n\"Tet spells\" (hypercyanotic spells): sudden, marked increase in cyanosis, dyspnea, limpness - Think \"Tet-a-tat-tat\" = rapid onset\nClubbing of fingers and toes (chronic hypoxemia)\nDifficulty feeding, poor weight gain\nFatigue, irritability\nHeart murmur (loud, harsh systolic ejection murmur) Polycythemia (increased red blood cells due to chronic hypoxemia)\nThromboembolism (stroke risk from polycythemia)\nBrain abscess (risk from paradoxical emboli)\nEndocarditis\nArrhythmias\nVentricular dysfunction Echocardiogram: Confirms diagnosis, visualizes all four defects\nChest X-ray: \"Boot-shaped\" heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy\nECG: Right ventricular hypertrophy, right axis deviation\nCardiac catheterization (less common for diagnosis, more for intervention planning)\nPulse oximetry: Low oxygen saturation Medical Management (temporary/palliative): Tet spells: Place infant in knee-chest position (increases SVR, decreases right-to-left shunt) - Knee-chest = Kicking Cyanosis\nAdminister oxygen\nMorphine sulfate (calms infant, decreases infundibular spasm)\nIV fluids\nBeta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) to prevent spasms Prostaglandin E1: To maintain patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in severe cases (to increase pulmonary blood flow) Surgical Repair (definitive): Usually performed between 4-6 months of age\nIncludes widening of the pulmonary outflow tract, patching the VSD, and addressing overriding aorta. Monitoring: Closely monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and signs of cyanosis.\nAssess for growth and development.\nMonitor for signs of heart failure (rare pre-op, can occur post-op). Tet Spell Management (NCLEX Tip): Prioritize knee-chest position first, then oxygen, then medications. Document spell characteristics and interventions. quiet environment\npacifier\nsmall &amp; frequent feedings\nswaddle or hold infant Fluid Balance: Maintain adequate hydration to prevent polycythemia and reduce stroke risk.\nInfection Prevention: Prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures/surgeries (to prevent endocarditis).\nPost-operative care: Strict I&amp;O, pain management, wound care, cardiac monitoring, gradual increase in activity.\nEmotional Support: Provide support to parents/caregivers, addressing anxieties and fears. Disease understanding: Explain TOF in simple terms, including the four defects and potential symptoms.\nTet spell recognition and management: Teach parents how to identify a tet spell and the appropriate actions (knee-chest position, remaining calm, seeking medical attention).\nMedication administration: Proper dosage, timing, and side effects.\nInfection prevention: Importance of good oral hygiene and prophylactic antibiotics.\nNutritional needs: Encourage frequent, small feeds; high-calorie formula if needed.\nActivity restrictions: Guide parents on appropriate activity levels for the child, balancing rest and play.\nFollow-up care: Emphasize the importance of regular cardiology appointments.\nSurgical preparation and post-op care: Prepare parents for the surgical process and what to expect during recovery.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"What is it","level":2,"id":"What_is_it_0"},{"heading":"Causes","level":2,"id":"Causes_0"},{"heading":"Patho","level":2,"id":"Patho_0"},{"heading":"Risk Factors","level":2,"id":"Risk_Factors_0"},{"heading":"Manifestations","level":2,"id":"Manifestations_0"},{"heading":"Complications","level":2,"id":"Complications_0"},{"heading":"Diagnostic","level":2,"id":"Diagnostic_0"},{"heading":"Treatment","level":2,"id":"Treatment_0"},{"heading":"Nursing Considerations","level":2,"id":"Nursing_Considerations_0"},{"heading":"Patient Education","level":2,"id":"Patient_Education_0"}],"links":["peds/cardiac/congenital/congenital-heart-diseases.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"peds/cardiac/congenital/r-l-shunt/tetralogy-of-fallot.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753472065000,"modifiedTime":1753472065000,"sourceSize":5214,"sourcePath":"Peds/Cardiac/Congenital/R-L Shunt/Tetralogy of Fallot.md","exportPath":"peds/cardiac/congenital/r-l-shunt/tetralogy-of-fallot.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":370,"backlinks":["peds/cardiac/congenital/congenital-heart-diseases.html"],"type":"markdown"},"peds/cardiac/congenital/r-l-shunt/tricuspid-atresia.html":{"title":"Tricuspid Atresia","icon":"","description":"\npart of <a data-href=\"Congenital Heart Diseases\" href=\"peds/cardiac/congenital/congenital-heart-diseases.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Congenital Heart Diseases</a>\nvalve between the right atrium and right ventricle fails to develop\ndeoxygenated blood mixes with oxygenated blood in the left atrium d/t patent foramen ovale (PFO)\nBlood in RA must cross ASD or PFO to LA From LA → LV → Part goes to aorta (systemic) Part goes through VSD or PDA to pulmonary artery Oxygenated &amp;

It involves a sac-like protrusion on the back containing meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and a portion of the spinal cord and nerves. Results in permanent neurological damage below the level of the lesion. Failure of the embryonic neural tube to close completely during the first month of pregnancy (around day 28). The exact cause is a multifactorial combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Incomplete closure of the posterior vertebral arch allows the spinal cord and meninges to herniate through the opening. The exposed neural tissue is underdeveloped and damaged, leading to a loss of motor and sensory function distal to the defect. Often associated with Chiari II malformation, where the brainstem and cerebellum are pulled downward, obstructing CSF flow and causing hydrocephalus. Folic acid deficiency before and during pregnancy is the most significant risk factor. Family history of neural tube defects. Maternal use of certain medications (e.g., valproic acid, carbamazepine). Maternal diabetes or obesity. Maternal fever or hyperthermia in early pregnancy. Visible sac-like lesion on the spine, most commonly in the lumbosacral region. The sac may be thin and prone to rupture. Paralysis or weakness of the lower extremities (flaccid paralysis). Lack of sensation below the level of the lesion. Neurogenic bladder and bowel: Incontinence, retention, and constipation due to lack of nerve control. Orthopedic issues: Clubfoot, hip dysplasia, and scoliosis are common. Hydrocephalus: Present in about 80-90% of infants, evidenced by a rapidly increasing head circumference and bulging fontanelles. Common: neurogenic bladder =&gt;always assess for bladder distention and incomplete emptying\nHydrocephalus: Requires placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Infection: High risk of meningitis if the sac ruptures. Tethered Cord Syndrome: Scar tissue forms and attaches the spinal cord to surrounding structures, causing progressive neurological deterioration. Chronic kidney disease from recurrent UTIs and urinary retention. Latex Allergy: Extremely common due to frequent exposure during surgeries and catheterizations. Assume every child with spina bifida has a latex allergy. 🤧 Prenatal: Elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screen, confirmed by fetal ultrasound and amniocentesis (which shows high levels of alpha-fetoprotein). Postnatal: Obvious physical defect at birth. An MRI or CT scan is used to assess the extent of spinal cord involvement and to check for hydrocephalus. Immediate Pre-operative Care: Protect the sac! The infant is placed in a radiant warmer to remain unclothed. Position the infant prone (on their stomach) to prevent pressure on the sac. Cover the sac with a sterile, moist, non-adherent dressing to prevent drying and rupture. Keep the area free of contamination from urine and feces (use a protective drape). Surgery: Surgical closure of the back lesion is typically performed within 24-72 hours of birth to reduce the risk of infection. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) Shunt: A shunt is surgically placed to treat hydrocephalus by draining excess CSF from the brain's ventricles to the abdominal cavity. Lifelong Management: Requires a multidisciplinary team (neurosurgery, urology, orthopedics, PT/OT). Includes clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for bladder management and a bowel program. NCLEX Tip: The absolute priority for a newborn with a myelomeningocele is to protect the sac from injury and infection. Pre-op Mnemonic - SAC: Sterile Dressing: Cover with a sterile, saline-soaked, non-adherent dressing. Change it regularly (q2-4h) to keep it moist. Asepsis: Use strict sterile technique. Monitor for signs of infection (fever, irritability, lethargy). Contamination Prevention: Position infant prone with hips slightly flexed to keep urine and stool away from the lesion. Post-op Care: Monitor vital signs, intake/output, pain, and the surgical incision for signs of infection or CSF leakage. Continue prone positioning until cleared by the surgeon. Hydrocephalus Monitoring: Measure head circumference daily. Assess fontanelles for bulging and monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) like a high-pitched cry, vomiting, and sunsetting eyes. Latex Precautions: Ensure a latex-free environment for all care. Use non-latex gloves, catheters, and supplies. Teach parents how to perform clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and manage a bowel regimen. Educate on the signs and symptoms of a VP shunt malfunction: headache, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, swelling along the shunt track, and changes in behavior or school performance. Explain the importance of a latex-free environment and provide a list of common latex-containing products (e.g., balloons, rubber toys). Instruct on proper skin care and positioning to prevent pressure injuries, especially on areas with no sensation. Encourage range-of-motion exercises to prevent contractures. Connect the family with the Spina Bifida Association and other community support resources.

Neuroblastoma = Nervous Baby Tumor Exact cause is unknown. It is thought to be a genetic mutation in the developing neural crest cells, which normally form the sympathetic nervous system. Most cases are sporadic, but a small percentage can be familial. Arises from immature neuroblasts in the adrenal glands (most common site), chest, neck, or spinal cord. The tumor secretes catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine), leading to various symptoms. Can metastasize early and widely to bone, bone marrow, liver, skin, and lymph nodes. Clinical Pearl: High levels of catecholamine metabolites (HVA and VMA) in urine are a key diagnostic marker Age: Occurs most often in infants and young children, with over half of cases diagnosed before the age of 2. Genetics: A small number of cases are hereditary. Abdominal Mass: A firm, irregular mass in the abdomen that can cross the midline. Unlike Wilms' tumor, it's often irregular. Metastasis: Bone pain or limp (bone metastasis) Periorbital ecchymosis (\"raccoon eyes\") and proptosis (orbital metastasis). Hepatomegaly (liver metastasis). Skin nodules (dermal metastasis). Catecholamine-related symptoms: Hypertension, flushing, and sweating\nDiarrhea (due to vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion) Other: Anorexia, weight loss, irritability, and fever. Metastatic disease. Spinal cord compression leading to paralysis. Bone marrow suppression from tumor infiltration or chemotherapy. Tumor-related syndromes like opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (\"dancing eyes and feet\") Urine Catecholamine Metabolites: Elevated levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA).9 This is a hallmark test. Biopsy: Confirms the diagnosis and staging.10 Imaging: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI to locate the primary tumor and assess for spread.\nBone Marrow Aspiration/Biopsy: To check for bone marrow involvement. MIBG Scan: A nuclear medicine scan that uses a radioactive tracer taken up by neuroblastoma cells to detect primary and metastatic disease. Surgery: To remove the primary tumor.\nChemotherapy: The main treatment for advanced disease. Radiation Therapy: Used for high-risk tumors or to treat specific sites of metastasis (e.g., bone pain, spinal cord compression) Stem Cell Transplant: For high-risk disease. Immunotherapy: A newer approach using antibodies to target neuroblastoma cells. NCLEX Tip: The hallmark of neuroblastoma is elevated urine HVA and VMA levels. Monitor for signs and symptoms of catecholamine excess (e.g., hypertension, tachycardia). Provide meticulous skin care due to risk of skin breakdown and pain from bone lesions. Monitor for and manage side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, vomiting, and myelosuppression (risk of infection, bleeding, and anemia). Neuroblastoma is NOT palpated, but unlike Wilms' tumor, a sign isn't posted to avoid it, as the tumor is often already metastatic and palpation won't change the prognosis. However, gentle handling is always a good practice. Provide comprehensive pain management, especially for bone pain. Explain the disease process and the importance of adhering to the complex treatment plan. Educate parents on monitoring for signs of infection (fever, chills) due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy. Advise on nutrition and hydration, as children may have a poor appetite. Teach parents how to manage pain and administer medications at home. Emphasize the importance of follow-up appointments and long-term monitoring.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Causes","level":2,"id":"Causes_0"},{"heading":"Pathophysiology","level":2,"id":"Pathophysiology_0"},{"heading":"Risk Factors","level":2,"id":"Risk_Factors_0"},{"heading":"Manifestations","level":2,"id":"Manifestations_0"},{"heading":"Complications","level":2,"id":"Complications_0"},{"heading":"Diagnostic","level":2,"id":"Diagnostic_0"},{"heading":"Treatment","level":2,"id":"Treatment_0"},{"heading":"Nursing Considerations","level":2,"id":"Nursing_Considerations_0"},{"heading":"Patient Education","level":2,"id":"Patient_Education_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"peds/oncologic/neuroblastoma.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1755289741000,"modifiedTime":1755289741000,"sourceSize":4061,"sourcePath":"Peds/Oncologic/Neuroblastoma.md","exportPath":"peds/oncologic/neuroblastoma.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":430,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"peds/oncologic/wilm's-tumor.html":{"title":"Wilm's Tumor","icon":"","description":"\nOne kidney chills, the other’s got Wilms =&gt;

also constricts peripheral and coronary blood vessels.\nContraindications: Hypersensitivity to methergine, hypertension (pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, chronic hypertension), cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease, hepatic or renal impairment, sepsis, threatened spontaneous abortion (before delivery of placenta), induction of labor.\nExpected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/cramping, dizziness, headache, diaphoresis.\nAdverse Effects: Severe hypertension (potentially leading to cerebral hemorrhage), seizures, palpitations, chest pain, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, stroke, allergic reactions (rash, anaphylaxis), ergotism (rare, with prolonged use or overdose: peripheral vasospasm, cyanosis, cold extremities).\nNursing Considerations: Assess blood pressure frequently (every 15 minutes or more often as indicated) during administration and for several hours afterward; monitor uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and fundal height; administer IV slowly over at least 60 seconds (rapid IV push can cause severe hypertension and cerebrovascular accident); monitor for signs of ergotism; educate patient about potential side effects and to report any severe headache, chest pain, or vision changes; typically given IM; IV is reserved for emergent situations due to risk of severe hypertension.\nSpecific Parameters to Discontinue Med: 140/90 BP or greater; signs of severe hypertension or neurological symptoms (e.g., severe headache, visual disturbances, seizures); chest pain or signs of myocardial ischemia. Indications: Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony that is unresponsive to other oxytocic agents; used in pregnancy termination.\nMechanism of Action: Potent prostaglandin F2-alpha analog; directly stimulates sustained contraction of uterine smooth muscle; also causes contraction of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle.\nContraindications: Hypersensitivity to carboprost or prostaglandins, acute pelvic inflammatory disease, active cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease, asthma (absolute contraindication due to bronchoconstriction); caution with hypertension, hypotension, anemia, jaundice, diabetes, epilepsy, previous uterine surgery (e.g., C-section).\nExpected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (very common due to smooth muscle stimulation), fever, chills, flushing, headache, tachycardia.\nAdverse Effects: Bronchospasm, wheezing, dyspnea, hypertension or hypotension, pulmonary edema, <a data-href=\"Uterine Rupture\" href=\"ob/iii.-labor/complications/uterine-rupture.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Uterine Rupture</a> (rare, especially with overuse or in grand multiparas), uterine hypertonus, tetanic contractions, arrhythmias, <a data-href=\"DIC\" href=\"med-surg/hematological/dic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">DIC</a> (disseminated intravascular coagulation, rare).\nNursing Considerations: Administer deep IM only; avoid IV administration; rotate injection sites if multiple doses are needed; monitor uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and vital signs (BP, pulse, respirations, temperature) frequently; have antiemetics and antidiarrheals readily available and consider pre-medication; auscultate lung sounds for signs of bronchospasm; assess for fever, which is a common but usually transient side effect; educate patient about common GI side effects.\nSpecific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Severe bronchospasm or respiratory distress; sustained severe hypertension or hypotension refractory to treatment; signs of uterine rupture. Indications: Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage when conservative management is insufficient; reduces blood loss in various surgical procedures and trauma.\nMechanism of Action: Antifibrinolytic agent; reversibly binds to plasminogen and plasmin, preventing fibrinolysis (breakdown of blood clots); stabilizes existing clots.\nContraindications: Hypersensitivity to TXA, active intravascular clotting (e.g., DIC, unless primary fibrinolysis is predominant), history of thrombosis (DVT, PE, stroke, MI), unless benefits clearly outweigh risks, severe renal impairment (dose adjustment needed), history of seizures (may increase seizure risk), color vision impairment (can mask retinal toxicity).\nExpected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, hypotension (if administered too rapidly IV), abdominal pain.\nAdverse Effects: Thromboembolic events (DVT, PE, stroke, MI) – although studies suggest low risk in PPH; seizures (especially with rapid IV administration or high doses); visual disturbances, impaired color vision; allergic reactions; renal cortical necrosis (rare, with prolonged use/high doses).\nNursing Considerations: Administer intravenously slowly over 10 minutes to prevent hypotension; monitor for signs of thrombosis (e.g., leg pain, swelling, chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological changes); assess for any changes in vision or color perception; monitor vital signs, uterine tone, and blood loss; ensure proper hydration; typically given within 3 hours of birth for PPH benefit.\nSpecific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Signs of active thrombosis (e.g., new onset chest pain, dyspnea, calf pain, neurological deficits); severe allergic reaction; new onset or worsening seizures; significant visual changes. Indications: Prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony; induction and augmentation of labor; to promote milk let-down (nasal spray, rare).\nMechanism of Action: Synthetic polypeptide hormone structurally identical to natural oxytocin; acts on oxytocin receptors in the uterus, causing rhythmic contractions of uterine smooth muscle; increases the frequency and intensity of contractions; also has antidiuretic effects at high doses.\nContraindications: Hypersensitivity to oxytocin, cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), unfavorable fetal position or presentation, significant placenta previa or vasa previa, umbilical cord prolapse, uterine hypertonicity or fetal distress when delivery is not imminent, severe toxemia, active genital herpes, undelivered placenta (before delivery of placenta in PPH management, it's typically given after delivery).\nExpected Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/cramping, headache, flushing.\nAdverse Effects: Maternal: Uterine hyperstimulation/tetany (leading to uterine rupture, placental abruption, fetal distress), water intoxication (hyponatremia, cerebral edema, seizures, coma) with high doses and large volumes of hypotonic fluids, hypotension or hypertension (less common), arrhythmias, postpartum hemorrhage (paradoxical, if receptors are saturated or overstimulated), allergic reactions; Fetal: Fetal distress (due to uterine hyperstimulation), bradycardia, hypoxia, acidosis.\nNursing Considerations: Administer as a dilute IV infusion via a pump, typically as a piggyback into a main IV line; never administer undiluted IV push in PPH management (can cause severe hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias); monitor uterine activity (frequency, duration, intensity of contractions), uterine resting tone, and vaginal bleeding; monitor vital signs (BP, pulse) frequently; assess intake and output to monitor for water intoxication; assess for signs of uterine hyperstimulation (contractions lasting &gt;90 seconds, less than 2 minutes apart, or resting tone &gt;20 mmHg); have tocolytics (e.g., terbutaline) available to relax the uterus in case of hyperstimulation.\nSpecific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Signs of uterine hyperstimulation (contractions too frequent, too long, or resting tone too high); signs of fetal distress (if used antepartum); signs of water intoxication (e.g., hyponatremia, decreased urine output, confusion, seizures); significant maternal hypotension or arrhythmia. Indications: Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony; cervical ripening and labor induction; abortion (medical); prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers.\nMechanism of Action: Synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog; causes strong uterine contractions; also causes cervical softening and dilation.\nContraindications: Hypersensitivity to misoprostol or other prostaglandins, known allergy to other prostaglandins; in the context of PPH, generally few absolute contraindications once the baby and placenta are delivered, as it's a critical situation; however, caution in patients with glaucoma, asthma (less of a concern than carboprost but still a prostaglandin), or severe cardiovascular disease; active gastrointestinal disease (if given orally for ulcer prevention).\nExpected Side Effects: Shivering, chills, fever (very common), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (common), abdominal pain/cramping, headache.\nAdverse Effects: Uterine hyperstimulation/tetany (leading to uterine rupture, especially with high doses or in cases of previous uterine surgery), hypotension or hypertension, bradycardia or tachycardia, allergic reactions, bronchospasm (less common than with carboprost), DIC (rare).\nNursing Considerations: Can be administered orally, sublingually, rectally, or vaginally for PPH; rectal administration is often preferred in emergent PPH due to rapid absorption and less GI side effects; monitor uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature) frequently; anticipate and manage shivering/chills with warm blankets; provide comfort measures for nausea and vomiting; educate patient about common side effects; ensure accurate dosage and route of administration.\nSpecific Parameters to Discontinue Med: Sustained uterine hypertonus not responding to other measures; signs of uterine rupture; severe allergic reaction.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Methergine (Methylergonovine)","level":2,"id":"Methergine_(Methylergonovine)_0"},{"heading":"Carboprost Tromethamine (Hemabate)","level":2,"id":"Carboprost_Tromethamine_(Hemabate)_0"},{"heading":"Tranexamic Acid (TXA)","level":2,"id":"Tranexamic_Acid_(TXA)_0"},{"heading":"Oxytocin (Pitocin)","level":2,"id":"Oxytocin_(Pitocin)_0"},{"heading":"Misoprostol (Cytotec)","level":2,"id":"Misoprostol_(Cytotec)_0"}],"links":["ob/iii.-labor/complications/uterine-rupture.html","med-surg/hematological/dic.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"pharmacology/obgyn/postpartum-hemorrhage/post-partum-hemorrhage-meds.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749656288000,"modifiedTime":1749656288000,"sourceSize":10066,"sourcePath":"Pharmacology/ObGyn/Postpartum Hemorrhage/Post-Partum Hemorrhage Meds.md","exportPath":"pharmacology/obgyn/postpartum-hemorrhage/post-partum-hemorrhage-meds.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":472,"backlinks":["ob/iv.-postpartum/complications/uterine-atony.html","pharmacology/obgyn/postpartum-hemorrhage/methylergonovine.html"],"type":"markdown"},"pharmacology/obgyn/abortion-medications.html":{"title":"Abortion Medications","icon":"","description":"\nIndication: Medical abortion, cervical ripening, postpartum hemorrhage\nMechanism: Prostaglandin E1 analog — stimulates uterine contractions and cervical softening\nNursing Implications: Monitor for uterine cramping and bleeding\nAssess for complete expulsion in medical abortion\nEducate on expected side effects (e.g., chills, fever, diarrhea, N/V, dyspepsia)\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of shock, such as tachycardia, hypotension, and anxiety.

Ability to complete ADLMental Illness - health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior (or a combination of these). Mental illnesses are associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work, or family activities.\" Mental Health Disorder - a diagnostic term for a group of mental illness manifestations.Mental Health Continuum - range of mental health functioning with adaptive (wellness, health coping) on one end of the spectrum and maladaptive (illness, unhealthy coping, or an inability to cope) on the other end of the spectrum.\nExcelling - highest level of well being, in that a person has fulfillment in life and the ability for personal success. Motivations for goal achievement, rational thoughts, ability to foster social relationships, and the ability to resolve stress.\nThriving - may experience stressors but can resolve those stressors. The nurse should look for plans or actions to process stress and the ability to foster social activity. Surviving - not a state of distress, but it is a state in which problems that may need action can be recognized. It may be described as the person feeling on edge. The nurse should look for nervousness, irritability, distraction, or withdrawnness.\nStruggling - may feel worthlessness, worried often, and that life is misery, but not all hope is lost. The nurse should look for poor performance in academic or occupational settings and dysfunctions in sleep and appetite.\nCrisis - severe symptoms and needs assistance.
